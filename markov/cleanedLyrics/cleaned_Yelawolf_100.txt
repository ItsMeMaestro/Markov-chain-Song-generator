best Friend.
aint never been much of the church type.
but I believe in the last days.
i walk through hell almost every night.
but I believe its a pathway.
say boy what you doin with your life.
with those tattoos on your face.
say boy you know that youll pay the price.
well I guess Ill see when I head that way.

to the Father Son and Holy Spirit.
i hold you nearest.
let the trumpets blow with your appearance.
i can almost hear it.
when you wish me hell upon my soul and spirit.
behold these lyrics.
yeah.

i dont know much about Holy Bibles.
i put my love for a woman on idle.
because I got beat with my mamas belt.
but I learned from my mistakes.
try hard to respect people for what they believin in.
but if you spit on my fuckin grave.
and wish me Hell then I wish you well.
ima send you straight up to my best friend.
to the Father Son and Holy Spirit.
i hold you nearest.
let the trumpets blow with your appearance.
i can almost hear it.
when you wish me hell upon my soul and spirit.
behold these lyrics.
yeah.
god please would you arm me with the armor.
to calm me when theres drama like Gandhi.
could have gone the other way many times.
could have turned Dalai with the llama but I squashed my.
beefs and things seem.
to be looking decent recently but dont jinx it.
its like Clint Eastwood looking for peace though.
maybe not finna enter the priesthood.
but at least should make an attempt to.
show some remorse and to be some sort of repenter.
for the people Ive been a menace to.
not a preacher but a shit starter and finisher.
enter the mind of a thick skin but a short temper.
this patience of mine is thinner.
than twine is when I.
get attacked so I might say something back.
that might offend ya.
so if you dont like when I rap or what I have to.
say on the mic then ya might wanna act just.
like quarterbacks and take a fuckin hike when I snap cause.
im a sinner and I I got a best friend best friend.
plus balls and intestines.
and they never been yes men.
they gon tell me when Im fuckin up the minute Im ever givin it less than.
im about to vomit and I can feel it comin.
cause failures somethin I can barely stomach.
and I only listen to my gut.
so unless youre my fuckin belly button.
dont tell me nuttin you aint my best friend best friend.
who you think Im talkin bout.
lifts me up when Im down and out.
still look to him without a doubt.
still got a best friend best friend.
shout it out.
like theres never been a louder mouth.
should have never been allowed a mouth.
now that I got a higher power now.
when I blackout power outageoww.
they powerless but they crowd around.
they tend to flock like shepherds the black sheep.
but Ill be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard.
when Im counted out.
youll be DOA theyll announce.
but pronounce you dead when they sound it out.
so prepare for a rival your arch enemy surrounds you now.
hes all around you pow.
not even the doctors at the hospital.
are gonna shiggyshock you back to life.
its impiggypossible to revive you.
thats word to the Diggy Doc.
stiggystoppin is not an option.
somethin Im not gonna do.
im the Iggy Pop of hiphop when I walk in the booth.
dawg Im the truth like Biggie rockin with 2Pac in a suit.
talkin to Proof droppin a deuce.
fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script cock it and shoot.
and who you thinks my Glock that I use.
that I pull from to get my strength up against these haters.
and hell be waitin at the gate when you get sprayed up.
sendin you hoes straight up to deal with my best friend.
to the Father Son and Holy Spirit.
i hold you nearest.
let the trumpets blow with your appearance.
i can almost hear it.
when you wish me hell upon my soul and spirit.
behold these lyrics.

heavens not a place that you can scare me into changing everything that I believe in.
leavin what is keeping you from walkin out the door and livin life like theres a reason.
reason is the fear of change will leave a person locked inside a dark and mental prison.
prisoners of war the war is media they feed to you graffiti up your vision.
visionary super scary future they will shoot ya they will loot ya they are killin.
killin power of the power that exists above us is a problem  its a sentence.
sentence you to pull and push and jump when they say jump you say how high.
there is no limit.
limit what they sell and what theyre givin.

even if the whole world knows.
i dont give a damn about what they think.
i dont have to stand up to your gun.
i dont have to sit down when you say.
tell me Im overboard.
the truth is you just want to see me sink.
if theres any room left on that ship.
you dont have to save any room for me.
and I will stay afloat  even when it rains.
cause ive got my own boat.

beasts are on the corner slingin poison to the junkies  to a junkie its a feast.

free yourself from anything they preach.

and left his snow yellow.
thats hard White Boy.
for the L O.

disappear.
daddy Ive been thinkin about you lately.
mamas never here and step daddy hates me.
he drinks a lot it makes him so mean.
mama always screams and it gives me bad dreams.
today I dropped my bowl of sghetti on the floor.
i didnt mean to make a mess I tripped on one of my toys.
i tried to clean it up really I tried.
but I just made it worse so I went to my room to hide.
i knew if Benny saw it Id be in so much trouble.
i didnt want to but I did.
and the thought of gettin hit scared me so I didnt tell him.
benny saw it he took off his belt and.
you know he hit me with it.
then he pushed my face in to the carpet where the sghetti spilted.
but I forgive him though.
i love you daddy I guess I gotta go.

theres a moth on my window sill.
and it came to die alone.
through the pain of the pouring rain.
i gaze into the storm.
and I imagine Im the son of a man.
who will hold me close and near.
with these bruises on my face I cry.
while I pray to disappear.
daddy are you there.
i know youre probably busy off working somewhere.
helpin somebody build a house or somethin neat.
you told me what you did carpentry right.
man thats so cool daddy.
i really miss you so much that I would kiss you.
yeah even front of my friends.
i guess you know Im gettin sick again.
ive been throwin up I havent been playin much.
i missed a lot of school this week but Im tough.
ill make it you know me daddy.
i dont get what I want most of the time but Im patient.
hey if you get a second.
maybe tomorrow you could come by just to check in.
because my babysitters crazy.
mama dont believe me but she makes me get naked.
and Im embarrassed so I hide it.
im tellin you because you know my heart and whats inside it.
i gotta go to sleep but dont turn off the lights.
i love you daddy or should I say Christ.
i gotta go to sleep but dont turn off the lights.
i love you daddy or should I say Christ.

theres a moth on my window sill.
and it came to die alone.
through the pain of the pouring rain.
i gaze into the storm.
and I imagine Im the son of a man.
who will hold me close and near.
with these bruises on my face I cry.
while I pray to disappear.
when the weeping willow tree sways from the breeze.
i float away.
to the end of the world to the moon to the stars.
to the heavens where Im safe.
im a child not a prey Im an angel enslaved.
im a life Im a world Im a rose put to waste.
wake me up let me live let me breathe let me breathe.
give me love give me soul give me guidance give me peace.


the Last Song.
everybodys askin me lately where Im from.
they wanna know what Ive been through and what dirt Ive done.
but man if I told you what Ive seen and been through then you probably run off.
that your scared of the truth so its dead and secret lined in chalk.
see Ive been lost ever since I could walk.
looking for my daddy in anyone of mammas boyfriends who would talk.
or listen to me when I spoke instead of lookin at me like a joke.
or leavin me behind leavin me to cry when you treated my momma like a ho.
but I learned quick that my daddy wasnt ever gonna come around.
and I didnt give a shit cause me and my momma we held it down.
no new kicks first day of school Im goodwill bound.
but when you come from the trench thats how you learn to walk around.
so I dont give a fuck if you ever lay eyes on top of my new shoes homey.
i just wanted you to know I didnt need a dollar from you I got em myself.
so if you find yourself in the middle of the floor with the bottle drinking yourself lonely.
then you can keep company with the picture of me in the magazine on the shelf turn the page.

daddy can you see me Im putting on a show.
in the magazines hear me on the radio.
so what do you think huh.
im sorry daddy you didnt get to watch me grow.
now Im always on the road no time to say hello.
yeah mamma you look greatperfect.
be safe on your first datefor certain.
if he brings you home too late Ill hurt him.
dont worry bout me Im safe Ill close the curtains.
and I feel like Im raisin you but what do I know baby blue.
all I know is that I was made in you so I put all my faith in you.
yeah I was only ten but I felt like a man and I had to let you go.
all I wanted was for us to be rich tear drops in my cereal bowl.
so I turned into an asshole young and dumb smokin weed.
vandalizing robbing houses stealing cars that was me.
but everything I did I had to see feel the pain had to grieve.
to become who I am and Im proud of the man I came to be.
what Ive learned cannot be taught what Ive earned cannot be bought.
justified deserve it all so dont be concerned its not your fault.
i never counted sheep I count my blessings.
so if you see him now momma dont give him the cold shoulder just give him my message.
just tell him.

daddy can you see me Im putting on a show.
in the magazines hear me on the radio.
so what do you think huh.
im sorry daddy you didnt get to watch me grow.
now Im always on the road no time to say hello.

bama.
thats.

to Whom It May Concern.
so I had a phone call with a good friend of mine the other night.
and um.
seems that Ive created some confusion.
he told me straight up.
people dont know you like I do man.
i guess I havent said enough.
or maybe Ive said too much I dont know.
but I dont wanna leave any stone unturned.
or no questions about who I am.
or what I represent.
so here you go.

i grew up in the deep gutter.
raised by wolves church steeples and a single white mother.
taught to be blind to any colour by hippies who been smoking weed since the 60s.
with Dukes of Hazzard for bed covers.
rocknroll country music and cocaine.
one hand on the Bible and the ouija board in the other.
the irony of it all is so thick that a fly would get stuck in the thin air of that dope smoke.
lynyrd Skynyrd and Michael Jackson.
practicing moonwalking with a broomstick in the kitchen popping and locking.
no BET on television we didnt have it we had the rabbits.
the tin foil Mason jar on the counter full of bacon oil.
now looking back talking bout freedom yeah you were spoiled.
oblivious to the hideous crimes from the insidious minds.
that took place right below us on the Southern soil.
the blood and the pain left a recoil.
the creekwaters holding secrets.
ghosts of Confederate veterans in the wind.
backwoods are haunted with the death and the sin.
slave ships carried the lost souls.
wicked white men slaughtering angels for a fucking bar code.
we buried these wicked ways the world is still turning.
and these motherfuckers with they crosses is still burning.
yeah I seen em at the courthouse.
not really sure what theyre trying to prove still.
jumped up on mountains theyre still trying to move hills.
and their daughters probably listen to Dru Hill.
pussy hotter than blue steel for Dru Hill.
so Jesus come take the wheel.
no you steer drunk.
the youth herere punks.
the truth here it come.
ill show you how these country folks pop that trunk.
uh and my honesty is modest.
to tell the whole truth yeah Ive pondered and Ive pondered.
to be spit at and called a wigger from who you considered a father at 14.
ll make you wonder and you wonder.
yeah thats hard to hear aint it.
but at that very moment my picture got painted.
call it God call it what you will.
but I knew the South was sick still and in need of some changes.
so I took it upon myself to adopt all the outcasts.
i took the American and the Confederate flag.
threw it in my back pocket I even went and got tatts.
and carried them like a shield for the shit that once held me back.
and these redneck brothers of mine playin that 36.
in a fucking cornfield in big trucks with lift kits.
oblivious to the beauty of juxtaposition.
they had no idea how special it was to witness.
them in deep Alabama playing Snoop and Group Home.
big Hank and Metallica I discovered a new zone.
and Catfish Billy a way for me to talk about it.
from them on I was questioned and highly doubted by my peers.
who didnt understand that all these years wed been the brunt of the jokes.
america made it clear that we were backwards wrong behind and segregated.
so I decided that Yelawolf would go make it more obvious that weve grown.
i polished up my tone I signed to Shady and brought a record deal home.
look mama no hands Im coming up yeah Im grown.
respect from the OGs cosigning my songs.
first it was Bun B then Raekwon and TIP.
then all of these MCs wanted features from me.
but I was a live wire my tongue was a fuckin blade to these critics.
who didnt get it the clips from the grenade in my teeth.
a little too unique the market for me was smaller than some thought it would be.
even me so I looked in the mirror.
saw the Jordans the gold chain my shirtPantera.
rebel flag in my pocket RED tattooed on my neck.
heart of Dixie across the stomach and it aint clicked yet.
maybe I wore the wrong shoes back to the woods because these suede No 5s cant get wet.
maybe its something I need to go figure out on my own.
so after Radioactive I took my shit back home.
disappeared from the world became increasingly different.
tuned in every once in a while to see who was spitting.
but mainly I was in Nashville getting back to my roots.
explorin music with Love Story I made it my truth.
dropped a single called Til Its Gone and travelled the globe.
i started seeing rebel flags everywhere at my shows.
i didnt think nothing of it I assumed that they get it.
im on some New South shit but I have to admit it.
i saw the posts up on Instagram proclaiming Im racist.
and that Im fucked in the head and I dont know where my place is.
i started taking it personal cause I treat people equal.
homie I got mixed kids and music is how I feed em.
lo and behold as Im saying this I discover this evil.
white boy went in a church and killed 9 innocent people.
goddamn hold on moment of silence.
nine innocent church going people get murdered.
theres not a word I can utter theres not a rhyme I can say.
there aint no fixing that ever those people brutally slain.
and I refuse to see ways to justify all the blame.
that motherfuckers insane.
i got so mad at my own image I took down merch.
no explaining it now its only making it worse.
this fucking coward this criminals just a puppet a mental case.
but the truth is the truth he did it because of race.
theres nothing I can describe the shame that I felt inside.
a white boy with the flag committed this homicide.
i tried so long to defend the South and yes it was my decision.
my interviews broke on the internet you can see my vision.
i never thought myself to be like a politician just a witness to the sickness.
the kindling was in the bridge and the bricks that I laid to the road.
that I built from the love and the wisdom.
im trying to find my way.
but now Im feeling imprisoned from the stereotypes.
i was prepared for the fight.
hell Ill be stereotyped until my burial site.
i married a loaded gun when I married this mic.
aint playing Russian roulette aint playing round with my life.
cause what I cannot lose is the respect that Ive gained.
friendships I cherish fuck the money and fame.
black American culture is in the thread of my veins.
its rocknroll till I die Im just a rebel in shame.
yes I apologize for me and anybody with that flag.
honestly any proud Southerner is sad.
how do you think I feel when I look at my grandad.
imagining him dead because of that piece of trash.
i got nephews nieces who need this peace between this.
but media is fiendish.
so if you feel like youre above it or beneath it.
have a logical mind about who your team is.
and when you look at me dawg dont look at me like another branch off a tree.
lord I took this shit and balanced it the best that I could.
try to hold up the wood of Americas old seesaw.
but this aint Hee Haw with MeMaw.
we aint on the Cosby Show are we bro.
daddy may give a goodnight kiss but I can promise you this.
that you aint promised tomorrow.
i wish I could go back to the innocence.
i remember my friends with no differences.
but pigment is relative isnt it.
maybe by 2050 well be over it.
big KRIT I love you homie keep killin shit.
you inspired this verse I got your back and thats limitless.
it is what it is we cannot fix all this ignorance.
slumerican flags up its over Im ending thisYou might also.

everything I Love the Most.
why is everything I love the most so wrong for me.
and everything Im holding close is so far away from me.
they dont want me to lie but they dont wanna hear the truth.
it never made sense to me.
why everything I love the most is so wrong for me.

yeah Problematic Im so problematic.
that Im probably a problem addict.
pop an aspirin cause my head is hurtin.
hotel bedroom missin curtains.
sheets everywhere like a storm has passed.
in fact it looks like I got into a wrestlin match.
empty bottle of Jack I could tell I did that.
i could smell it in fact its like death and ass.
think for a minute if I look over and look.
to my left is an opened book a Bible.
to my right is a guilty conscience and her name is Brooke my rival.
at least I think her name was Brooke.
shes asleep and Im givin her the lamest look.
move her hair back so that I could see your face.
cause it was dark and I met her at the game it took.
about 5 minutes to get her inside the whip.
another 5 minutes to get up inside the lips.
never try really man I really tried to slip out.
but it was just thighs and hips.
oK I was high shit.
on alchohol and the Yelawolf ego trip.
leave her lying in bed cause I dont need no kiss.
and its the walk of shame again.
why is everything I love the most so wrong for me.
and everything Im holding close is so far away from me.
they dont want me to lie but they dont wanna hear the truth.
it never made sense to me.
why everything I love the most is so wrong for me.

smokin hot throw it up.
keep a fifth off in my cup.
trying not to be a simp.
but every time I take a sip.
i think Im gonna fall in lust.

in a house that never runs out of boxes.
knowing that if I put on my tennis shoes.
and a fresh fit Ill end up sockless.
by the end of the night flip flopping.
ill BBoy if you let me Hip Hop in.
alligator skin cowgirl boots only means lets get it crockin.
that mini skirt makes any man a flirt.
manicures animal furs and a purse.
what could a little bit of smoke and Henny hurt.
you make any jerk make a penny work.
sinister with sin in her.
she can leave a devil sitting in the church.
on another level not in the earth.
jessica Alba had twins at birth.
trippin sure piles of E ménageatrois piles of three.
waking up again not proud of me.
yeah Im a lousy fiend.
why is everything I love the most so wrong for me.
and everything Im holding close is so far away from me.
they dont want me to lie but they dont wanna hear the truth.
it never made sense to me.
why everything I love the most is so wrong for me.

shadows.
memories of shadows haunt me.
from the years when I was young.
things that used to terrify me.
are the things that Ive become.

theres a dark moon in the clouds.
misty fog in the swamp.
crickets chirpin outside my window.
the water it thumps in the bathroom sink down the hall.
the lights flicker sometimes.
the wind is howling the dogs are growling way deep in the pines.
a passin car on the distant road the only thing running.
nightmares in my sleep the Sandman is coming.
i see the ghost in the red cloak the shadows are taking shape.
the sound of a faint voice lost and full of hate.
dry leaves crumble under the feet of the reaper.
the limbs tap on my window like the nails of a creature.
tales of goblins and fairies a sacrifice on the prairie.
a murderer that escaped Im disillusioned and weary.
lightning strikes on the hill illuminating the cabin.
the old man on the porch evil and quietly laughing.
surrounded by demons.
im an angel and they all want me.
and to this day.
memories of shadows haunt me.
from the years when I was young.
things that used to terrify me.
are the things that Ive become.
cigarette buds and oil stains on the dying grass.
the smell of the liquor rising up from the broken glass.
the crowds of black leather the heat from the engines.
motorcycles and goons bearded men and loud women.
the cracklin paint the old shack with the swingin light.
the heroin needles passin open in plain sight.
ozzy and Black Sabbath the vinyl is skippin.
from the fight in the kitchen.
blood screamin and kickin.
smoke fills up the sky gasoline on the trash heap.
the mattress is burnin I hear it poppin and snapping.
the rain soaked teddy bear so heavy I cant lift it.
the flask for the moonshine I watch as they all sip it.
the Halloween pumpkin candle lit with a Pentagram.
the Grandfather clock with a broken minute hand.
surrounded by thieves killers thugs and some junkies.
and to this day.

memories of shadows haunt me.
from the years when I was young.
things that used to terrify me.
are the things that Ive become.
i throw on my leather jacket a collection of biker patches.
one of them says savage the other one Black Sabbath.
heavily tatted barely any skin left.
whiskey bent after twelve Im always playing with death.
bullet shells in my yard loaded gun on the shelf.
run the roads like a wolf through the whole Bible Belt.
rattlesnake skin boots toes up on the chopper.
fifty Harleys behind me they all ready to slaughter.
drunk in front of my sons drunk in front of my daughter.
spit cuss and I yell its like a onesided quarter.
cause Im only heads up no matter which way you flip it.
no brake lights in my life Im either rich or evicted.
committed to my convictions committed crimes with the quitters.
connected to my religion the religion of sinners.
send a prayer to God exhaling smoke off the meth pipe.
like puddles reflecting the ripples echo to next life.
so here I am standing just like the ashes that fell from the fire.
a seed that fell off that poisonous and forgotten flower.
became my own nightmare but now I think its charming.
especially when.

memories of shadows haunt me.
from the years when I was young.
things that used to terrify me.
are the things that Ive become.
bloody bone gon get you.
bloody bone gon get you.
bloody bone gon get.

growin Up in the Gutter.
once upon a time in an apartment home.
lived a little girl with a heart of stone.
cause part of her heart was partly gone.
rarely seen and hardly known.
treated like a mat in a boxing ring.
blood drop stains on the twin box springs.
daddy came to visit its not a dream.
she thought to herself what is happening.
above her head is a crucifix.
but Lucifer loosens up his wrist.
lays her down with an open fist.
and all that was left was hopelessness.
little girl wheres your loving mother.
under the covers under the covers.
little girl what have you discovered.
she stuttered.

stray guns no aim yea.
growin up in the gutter.
cause even in suburbia somebody will murder ya.
over nothin leave your body slumpin in the parkin lot of your complex.
violence is a hard pill to swallow and digest.
my town is full of drug dealers most of em get shot in the process.
hustlin and stackin up profits.
they robbin mutherfuckas like they havin a contest.
shit he took a bitch to his apartment to brag.
a week later he tied up on the carpet and gagged.
cause he showed her all the pills he had for sale for the low.
she told her cousin then her cousin grabbed a Glock and a mag.
kickedin his door laid him down then he shot him and dashed.
ran off with all that he had used to be ballin now he got a colostomy bag.
what you know about that.
middleclass white bitch slangin her body for crack.
mexican drug cartels you hear the buckshot shells.
and then the blood clot fails there aint no healin the wounds.

obama must be cool with me then I guess if Im packin up this Honda.
i highly doubt it but fuck it its worth a shout out.
at least thats what I tell the judge before I gracefully bowed out.

my grandparents retired from 9 to 5s.
they paid for my hospital bills when mama was doin lines.
i wasnt raised up like the model American.
but I love what it made me life is all about where and whens.
whos and hows that ultimately create my heritage.
my great grandaddy Otis would sit down in his chair and then.
smoke a cigarette while he sipped on Muscadine moonshine.
homemade and reminisce about the old days.
he died of cancer when I was 5.
i wasnt allowed to go see him in his casket cause I wouldve cried.
i got so much value off life in such a short time.
memories stick to my heart and today they still apply.
they used to share crops when they were poor.
he worked his ass off at the mill and then he opened up a store.
both of my granddaddies fought a war.
so I could say what Im sayin in this record for you and yours.
for you and yours the truth.
they said the sky is the limit.
well I guess it all depends on you.
and your views.
in this American dream.
dont tell me that the sky is the limit.
cause it aint about what you can do.
its a who knows who.

drugs.

i never was the one in the classroom sitting with my hand up.
when the teacher told us that we needed to report.
anything that was happening at home.
like if I saw pipes or things of that sort.
cocaine dime bags laying on my front porch.
never made me feel sick til I found out what it was.
no telling how many adults went in through my home.
had a convo with me unavailable.
and maybe Ive caught the vibe and maybe theyre right.
and maybe Ill follow them footsteps of my folks.
but thats only a theory cause of the people near me.
love me enough to never let me do that dope.
but the crew I roll with knew that road.
we took a left turn and pursued that dough.
i remember being scared of the goons in the room.
passing needles around spooning smoke.
at the time my young mind was curious.
gullible and naive still.
i run around the apartments hidden in darkness.
and sparked it with Chris Robby and Will.
and I didnt like the feeling at first.
the taste in my mouth or the smell on my clothes.
but I kept showing up after school to be cool.
i would do anything with the bros.
and I told my mama lies over and over.
what I was doing and where did I go.
didnt hurt my feelings anymore.
i didnt care about being an asshole.
unless my girlfriend found out.
that my backpack had a fat packed out roll.
but out the blue she pulled a joint out her purse.
that she stole from her folks and thats all that she wrote.
i quote.

back in 1979 it was a cold day in December.
mamma peeled the paint off the wall screamin.
babies on the way.
they rushed her to the hospital in that old Chevy truck.
running 90 miles an hour down them back roads.
blowing past the sheriff  hid in the woods smoke bellowing off the engine.
running hot must have been a sign.
they rushed her to the emergency room.
and barely made it to the bed.
a few minutes later I was screaming for my first breath.
a little devil the doctor said.
hes got that look in his eye ya know.
reminds me of mischief.
yeah this ones gonna be trouble I can tell it.
and then the lights went.
then mamma said doctor somethings burning I can smell it.

and it was trial by fire.
im just under a plane singing to burn it down.
you better watch your step.
when I come around.

damn right uh.
you could hear lightning for miles around.
and oak trees hitting the ground.
the wind tore holes on that old Dixie flag on the capitol steps.
change is coming my great grand mamma said.
quietly clutching her Bible sitting in a rocking chair smoking a cigarette.
and the wood creaked beneath the porch and the old dog moaned and cried.
as the sirens passing by.
and Mr Williams brought a mean batch of that moonshine to the wake.
you know one comes and one goes as they say.
and they laid a flower on the grave.
buried on December 29th for robbing a bank.
and killed by the police see you in the next life old friend.
little did he know his old friend was back again.
as the son of Sheila Diane.
and it was trial by fire.
im just under a plane singing to burn it down.
you better watch your step.
when I come around.

you know how the story goes cmon.
see me Im a curious soul.
a stray bullet to some a chatter and whisper at night and the head of a following storm a rebel at heart a devilish grin.
a leader of men a preacher at ten.
i was already in to spiritual sin.
back in the saddle again.
12s in the back of the trunk making it rattle again.
giving them nothing but punk.
living the baby the babies got powers the baby is haunted.
fuck a church Im a confession.
professional public annointed.
came from the wrong side of the tracks.
bring the wrong crowds out the back.
keeping these gutter dogs raised.
with these alley way cats.
seen what these others cant see.
my poetry is a reflection of life looking up from the bottom.
and climbing that fucking tree but I brought a chainsaw.
i come to build a house up out of it chopping.
limbs off this culture and putting soliders up inside of it.
nails brick mortar board up the windows.
for the tornado Im a fatal blow to these honorable foes.

keeps Me Alive.
way back in Alabama where the dirt roads cut through the woods.
and when it rains you can smell the steam off the grass.
even dew on the hood of my paw paws 1985 Chevrolet Silverado.
i must have been about six.
life was so easy back in the sticks.
16 year old mother fought for the life she wanted for her son.
lookin for love in the world of rock and roll is where it begun.
it was Alabama Ted Nugent.
alice Cooper Randy Travis.
aerosmith kept my stepdaddy on the road.
and life it was madness.
cocaine and alcohol filled up the house party to be frank.
it wasnt long before I tried it myself and then started to drink.
school became boring and doing my homework became rollin joints.
now Im sixteen like my mama was when she had a little boy.
cant imagine that now as I look back cause I got three kids of my own.
and I respect what she went through to pay for food and clothes.
and a home.
cause it aint what she did its what she didnt do for me.
that brought me to this moment.
and made me who I am on this recording.
and this is my story.

this is my story.
this is my glory.
this is what keeps me alive.
this is me flying.
this is me trying.
this is what keeps me alive.
20 years old in the streets and Im rollin with gangsters now.
hiphop is takin over me my language my clothes my lifestyle.
antioch Tennessee put me through the school of hard knocks.
and I carry that attitude with me to this day more or not.
and Im young and hotheaded.
always running from police and skateboardin.
graffiti loiterin I sorta got my peace from the chaos.
was no mothermayIs surrounded by havenots.
and maybe some day Is well.
i was against the grain even when I was growin wheat.
got back into rock and roll and then got into poetry.
started expressin everything I could through the medium of pen and pad.
playin instrumentals off a tape and then overdubbin what I had.
it was everything because I had nothin.
and man that was alright cause now I had somethin.
little did I know that would be the hardest thing to do God ever put before me.
so I took a look at what Ive been through.
and I made it my glory and this is.

this is my story.
this is my glory.
this is what keeps me alive.
this is me flying.
this is me trying.
this is what keeps me alive.
its a 2 AM bus craw from me at the parkin lot of WalMart.
leavin Nashville Tennessee for a nationwide tour.
my bags are all packed and Im loadin my truck to go meet the crew.
and Im excited to get on the road already one foot out the door.
turn around and its my daughter shes cryin.
cause daddy is leavin.
knows that Ill be gone for months and it hurts and I hate to see it.
kneel down and tell her Look baby I promise Ill call you everyday.
and daddy will send you a present from everywhere that we go play.
but thats not enough and its breakin my heart in two.
just knowin I cant stay not even to see it through.
and that I cant tuck her in to say goodbye with a grin.
now shes bein left behind this is me all over again man.
i picked her up in my arms and held her tight.
and said Hey you know what Daddy used to be just like you.
when I would walk up to the bus.
and Id do anything in the world for you so chase your dreams.
one day youll use everything youve been through to be anything baby girl.
this is my story.

this is my story.
this is my glory.
this is what keeps me alive.
this is me flying.
this is me trying.
this is what keeps me.

he took a thirdshift and hes just gettin in.
babies are hungry and mommy is bitchin.
bout bills that he need to go pay while he sittin.
not even five minutes to drink a cold beer before hearing about what was left in the kitchen.
walk out the door for a walk to the store bread was five dollars he only had four.
wont get a check til the first of next week and he said to himself I cant take anymore.
with no heat in the house and no gas in the truck and his fouryearolds birthday about to come up.

what would you do for love.
what would you do for love.

shes a single mother livin in a hotel in the south side of the city.
and she works at a bar in the strip to get tips savin up for a place that is pretty.
a twelveyearold son to support still in school with a father thats never around.
he took her virginity promised infinity.
then he took off and he hasnt been found.
most of the people she already knows.
have trouble survivin and keepin a home.
that side of town aint the place to raise a child.
but shes doing her best and theres no where to go.

he knows just what she does.
his mama cant work at the bar every night.
so his mama is hustlin and sellin drugs.

once upon a time not long ago.
my grandmother told me one day Id change.
i felt like she was comin down on me.
so I told her no Id be the same.
not knowin she was only tryin to help.
motivate me to excel and climb.
i was thinking she was the one trapped.
while I was stuck in a cage of my mind.
man if I wouldve known what I know now.
i wouldve brought my head down under the cloud.
told her thank you and that I loved her.
but I was too cool and too damn proud.
what a fool I was in fact.
ive changed so much now lookin back.
i wish somebody I thought was cool.
was as cool as she was when she told me that.

i see you the real you.
tryna cover up whats inside of you.
but everything you do is makebelieve.
yeah youre hot but youre too cool.
i see you oh.
i see you oh.
i see you.
baby girl dont know much about.
what it would take to become a star.
hollywood is so farfetched.
too long of a drive in an old car.
work everyday but you barely eat.
goin over lines from a script you read.
your boyfriend said its a silly dream.
but how can you dream when you never sleep.
you lookin in the mirror and youre picturin a lightshow.
a glimpse in the lens of a camera.
behind the scenes of life is a tightrope.
yeah you walk a thin line but a thin line is all you need.
a thin line in an indy movie.
just a break for somebody to see.
the talent inside the ballad of a diary you write.
the by and by is just another day for a normal girl.
but for you its another day that you tried.
aside from the fact that you ride in the back.
of a bus sometimes cause your car wont work.
well maybe you should take that bus to LA.
and put your dreams first because.

i see you the real you.
tryna cover up whats inside of you.
but everything you do is makebelieve.
yeah youre hot but youre too cool.
i see you oh.
i see you oh.
i see you.
black and white.
everything is black and white brokedown simple and plain.
most of us lost with a curious brain.
curiosity is looked at as strange.
stuck in a lane but you cant complain.
while you look at another passin train.
wonderin how wheres it going.
wishin you were inside packed and rollin.
to another place but your time is chosen.
to live lowkey cause your dream is stolen.
they dont understand they believe in loathin.
loungin loafin waitin hopin.
homie if the grass is greener look the gate is open.
you waitin for God to release the ocean.
sittin on the beach 2 feet from floatin.

i see you the real you.
tryna cover up whats inside of you.
but everything you do is makebelieve.
yeah youre hot but youre too cool.
i see you oh.
i see you oh.
i see.

Ain't never been much of the church type
But I believe in the last days
I walk through hell almost every night
But I believe it's a pathway
Say, boy, what you doin' with your life
With those tattoos on your face?
Say, boy, you know that you'll pay the price
Well, I guess I'll see when I head that way

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
I hold you nearest
My best friend (Best friend)
Let the trumpets blow with your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend (Best friend)
When you wish me hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend (Best friend)
Yeah, I got a best friend (Best friend)
Yeah

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
I don't know much about Holy Bibles
But I grew up in the Bible Belt (Uh)
I put my love for a woman on idle
Because I got beat with my mama's belt
But I learned from my mistakes
Try hard to respect people for what they believin' in
But if you spit on my fuckin' grave
And wish me Hell, then I wish you well
I'ma send you straight up to my best friend

[Verse 3: Eminem & Yelawolf]
God, please would you arm me with the armor
To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi?
Could have gone the other way many times
Could have turned Dalai with the llama, but I squashed my
Beefs, and things seem
To be looking decent recently, but don't jinx it
It's like Clint Eastwood looking for peace though
Maybe not finna enter the priesthood
But at least should make an attempt to
Show some remorse and to be some sort of repenter
For the people, I've been a menace to
Not a preacher but a shit starter and finisher
Enter the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner
Than twine is when I
Get attacked, so I might say something back
That might offend ya
So if you don't like when I rap or what I have to
Say on the mic, then ya might wanna act just
Like quarterbacks and take a fuckin' hike when I snap 'cause
I'm a sinner, and I, I got a best friend, best friend
Plus balls and intestines
And they never been yes men
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up the minute I'm ever givin' it less than
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it comin'
'Cause failure's somethin' I can barely stomach
And I only listen to my gut
So unless you're my fuckin' belly button
Don't tell me nuttin', you ain't my best friend, best friend
Who you think I'm talkin' 'bout?
Lifts me up when I'm down and out
Still look to him without a doubt
Still got a best friend, best friend
Shout it out
Like there's never been a louder mouth
Should have never been allowed a mouth
Now that I got a higher power, now
When I blackout, power outage—oww
They powerless, but they crowd around
They tend to flock like shepherds, the black sheep
But I'll be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard
When I'm counted out
You'll be D-O-A, they'll announce
But pronounce you dead when they sound it out
So prepare for a rival, your arch enemy surrounds you now
He's all around you– pow!
Not even the doctors at the hospital
Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life
It's im-piggy-possible to revive you
That's word to the Diggy Doc
Stiggy-stoppin' is not an option
Somethin' I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth
Dawg, I'm the truth, like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in a suit
Talkin' to Proof, droppin' a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock it and shoot
And who you think's my Glock that I use
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters?
And he'll be waitin' at the gate when you get sprayed up
Sendin' you hoes straight up to deal with my best friend
[Chorus: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
I hold you nearest
My best friend (Best friend)
Let the trumpets blow with your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend (Best friend)

Till It’s Gone
101 ContributorsTill It’s Gone Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm not the table you can come and lay your cup down on now
I’m not the shoulder for a bag, don't wanna carry your heavy load
I'm not the road that you take when you're lookin' for a shortcut, uh
I ain't the steppin' stone, to be steppin' on, I ain't nobody's crutch
I ain't the money man, with your money man, you ain't lookin' at me
I'm not the cheap one, lookin' at me son, you ain't lookin' at free
I ain't the dishrag, to come clean up, all the shit that ya dish out
Ain't got no check for 'em, if you checkin' in
Mothafucka check this out

[Chorus]
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, but what can I do if I do 'til it's gone

[Verse 2]
I'm not the trash can, not the last man at the finish line now
I'm not the new kid, on the block
That you can just follow and push around
I'm not the fuckin' needle in the haystack, that you finally found
This ain't no free rent, come and pitch a tent, you ain't tying me down
I'm not a bus ride you can hop inside, and just roll away clean
Not the wheel on the wagon you wanna break
'Cause I hold up the weight for the team
I'm not the gold watch, and the new truck
That you scheming to check out
Unless you're looking to check out [shot, shot, shot]
What a mess now (c'mon)

And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can

Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, what can I do if I do 'til it's gone

[Verse 3]
I jump to the sky for my people
I walk through the fire, I give love when it's equal
Don't tell me not to complain about my money and fame
When you come around and tellin' me I changed
Damn right I fuckin' changed
When this fuckin' change in my pocket
Hit the bucket, it was a rocket all a sudden
I went from shoppin' without nothin'
To goin' shoppin' for my cousins
Now that the cops know that I'm buzzin'
They wanna drop me in the oven
Pull me over just to say "I'm a fan"
Hip-hop, gotta love it, fuck it
[Chorus]
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, what can I do if I do 'til it's gone137Embed

American You
63 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEnglishFrançaisAmerican You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Man, you got it all worked out
Don't you? Old pair of shoes
Never wear your heart on your sleeve
Cause it don't go with the suit
You got a bad, bad woman with a young little pretty face
They told you not to go get married
But you went and did it anyway

[Chorus]
Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too

[Verse 2]
Mama said steer clear of the devil
So you never played in the road
Always lookin' on the bright side
So you never see the potholes
You got a house on a hill
Big news, that's a big deal
Big party with your big time friends
Man, imagine how that feels

[Chorus]
Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too

I believe in the modest dream, ain't lookin' for a pot of gold
A 6 pack and some good marijuana, I can watch my mama roll
I believe I could buy a few things like a house with a nice pool
Invite my nobody friends to the party and we’ll pee in it, fuck you

[Verse 4]
You got a blue-collar father who drinks Budweiser out the bottle
20 dollars, an old Impala, a baby's mama
You work hard, you don't beg, you don't borrow
Night at the factory, daytime job at McDonald's
Your daddy told you that girl was nothin' but a problem
But you fell in love 'cause to you she was like a supermodel
And they told you not to go get married
But you went and did it anyway
It ain't no problem
You make somethin' out of nothin', you make money for a livin'
Pushin' buttons, diggin' ditches, flippin' burgers in the kitchen
With the vision, you've been dreamin', you've been savin'
You've been given nothin' but shit
But you take it cause you're patient in this prison
Fuck everybody dissin', it ain't them who's gotta live in this skin
With all these tattoos that you got that fuckin' offends them
If it's you that I'm speakin' to, you must be my extension
I take my drink up and sip it, take my hat off and tip it
Slumerican
[Chorus]
Oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through

Catfish Billy
62 ContributorsCatfish Billy Lyrics[Intro]
I've got a lot of things to do
Like what?
Doesn't matter, I don't want Pa to skin me alive like he's gonna do to you if he finds out
Pa said not to bother him. And if he's not gonna be home, how can I bother him?
It'd be better if you just forget about it
Well I'm going to do it, and I'm gonna take Jack with me, cause Pa didn't say anything to him

[Pre-Verse]
Way down this country road in a holler
Where they make that moonshine still
There's an old man on the porch on a shack
And the shack is where he lives
Round the town they call him Pa
It's Pa from on the hill
And every time Pa does slay a hog
You can hear that hoggy squeal

[Verse 1]
I’m from the belly of the Bible Belt
That motherfuckin' preacher daughter's son
Where you can't find no woman, no man
No cousin, no friend without a gun
Alabama, that is my home
But the trailer park has got my heart
Off in the hood, I'm at home
When I play in the woods after dark
You won't find me sober much
Always got the bottle of Jacky O
I take my sips, I talk my shit
And I fight anybody that wants to go
Tall and slim, walk with a limp
Cause my nuts are oversized
Fuck your dope and your alcohol
Because your shit is overpriced
Hit the bootleg for 24 before I'm 21, math'matics
Going to jail cause I'm drunk at Piggly Wiggly, (dagnabbit)
Cause I be here and I do my time
Cause I can't make bail on minimum wage
Nothing to do in the country but get drunk
And watch that pendulum sway
Back in the saddle again
Throw my middle finger up to the law
I ain't gotta rob nobody tonight
But I might do it just because
I'm a nut, I get bored
Did some pills, but I want more
Fuck this world, fuck this town
If I fuck you once, I fuck you sore
Fuck, fuck, fuck, shit, goddamn
Pussy cunt, bitch suck a cock
If you want some of this rock-and-roll
Take this pipe, suck this rock
Where's the fire, Super-Hot
Clean em' up, grab a mop
Catfish on my shit
Fuck with me, you gonna get dropped

You don't want it with me, motherfucker
I promise I'll put you with the piranhas
Inside of a shallow swamp
And then make you follow a boat full of drinking-water
And sing to you lullabies
While I sip on Coronas under umbrellas
Got a propeller
Sharp enough to eat through a two-footed root of a tree
If it's under me, then it's cool
I keep movin'
So why do you think a fuckin' hater
Would lay a log in front of my boat
And put a stop to what I do? Buddy, whatever
When I get up in the morning I think about
When it's all over they can put my body up in the river
With everything I did for the culture inside of a book
And light a candle for my mama
Who got sick from the fucking fame
Immediately
Media will follow me to the end of the river
While the people around my body deliver
Rhythms and syllables relevant of my scripture
I'm a sick son of a bitch, do you get the picture?
[Interlude]
My fucking name is
Catfish
Really, though...

Pop the Trunk
75 ContributorsPop the Trunk Lyrics[Verse 1]
Meth lab in the back
And the crack smoke peels through the streets
Like an early-morning fog
Momma's in the slaughterhouse with the hatchet
Helping Daddy chop early-morning hog
I'm catching Zs like an early-morning saw
When I woke up to the racket, yawn and pause
What the fuck, man? I can never get sleep, man
Peeped out the window, what's wrong with y'all?
Stood up in my Crimson Tide Alabama sweatpants
And threw my pillow
Looks like Daddy caught the motherfucker
That tried to sneak in and steal his elbows
They don't know that old man don't hold hands or throw hands
Nah, he's rough like a Brillo
Went to the Chevy and pulled out a machete
And a gun as heavy and tall as that midget, Willow

[Chorus]
Think he's playin'?
You better listen what he's sayin', punk
Don't make me go pop the trunk
On you
He got an old Mossberg
In the Mossy Oak duffle bag laying in the back of the dump, boy
Don't make me go pop the trunk
On you
Think he's playin'?
You better listen what he's sayin', punk
Don't make me go pop the trunk
On you
He got an old Mossberg
In the Mossy Oak duffle bag laying in the back of the dump, boy
Don't make me go pop the trunk

11:30, and I'm pulling up dirty
Smoking babbage out the back of my buddy's Monte Carlo
Spitting over some Supa Hot Beats
With a super hot freak we call "the parking lot ho"
You know we sipping on that old brown bottle
Bass in the trunk make the whole town wobble
So when we ride around, bitches follow
And tonight, one of them bitches is giving us problems
Well, one of them bitches
Been fucking one of my homeboy's favorite bitches
And he's been on his hit list for a minute
And I think he's ready to handle his business
He told me "Yelawolf, get this"
And he handed me the Cartier watch that was on his wrist
He said "Watch this shit"
And he jumped to the trunk and grabbed his biscuit, biscuit

[Chorus]
Think he's playin'?
You better listen what he's sayin', punk
Don't make me go pop the trunk

[Verse 3]
Two men stand
One's gotta go
One falls down to the ground
One walks down to the road
Momma better call the police
Now he's screaming, "No!"
Took a buckshot to the chest
With a rock-salt shell, and he's moving slow
All this blood has spilled
Enough to give a penguin chills
Hot enough to make a potato smoke
At the tip of the hollowed steel
In the valley of the hollowed field
In the valley of the hollowed tip
This ain't a figment of my imagination, buddy
This is where I live! Bama!

I must be Jim Morrison to get a motherfucking girl like you
Don’t know what I did in my past life, but it must have been something cool
Cause I’m a whiskey drinking, fight provoking, cigarette smoking dude
I got a problem with my attitude, it’s hard for me to keep cool
But when I look at you, I see me, a reflection of a real soul
So, pardon me if I may seem loose and out of control
It ain’t the drink talking, it’s me talking; fuck if everyone knows
You my girl and that’s that, so hop on the back of this bike and roll
Let’s roll now

[Hook: Yelawolf]
I’d never let someone straight up disrespect you
I’d never let someone call you out your name
I’ll always be the one that runs up to protect you
‘Cause I know if I was down, you’d come and do the same
So let’s pack it up and move our life to Nashville
Build a studio in the house and do our thing
And I’ll take you out and we’ll go honky tonkin’
Get drunk and fall in Tennessee Love
Tennessee Love
Fall in Tennessee Love
Fall in Tennessee Love
Fall in Tennessee Love

Can’t you see that my hands are shaking?
Withdrawals from alcohol Ain’t no use in us fakin'
But it’s our life, ain’t it baby? So ain’t no use in us takin'
A chance with it, so I promise that I’ll work on my patience
Someday, if we get lucky and we grow and get old
We’ll look back, and laugh about the circus and the show
But for now, we live it up, we spend it up, and we go
To the last call in every bar in this town turn the lights on and close

And I had to earn it back and I learned in fact
That money don’t fix that shit

[Verse]
Yeah, never had to walk away from anybody
Always been about it from the jump
Yeah, never been a hater, never gave a fuck about a hater
Never been a punk
Yeah, been an innovator, fuck a imitator
Drop another hot potato, son
Take 'em back to Piedmont Park
With Baby D and the Kings of Crunk
Rest in peace Grip Plyaz, Speakerfoxxx, and Lenny's Bar
Rest in peace Zoo, you ain't dead but to me you are
Still Dixie Mafia bitch, still wavin' that flag, I'm
New South in everything I drop, whether I sing or rap, ask Dax
Suit up, you gonna need a hazmat
Leavin' these fuckers chewed up
Like a muskrat in a backpack
I'll hang up the Ku Klux and I ain't got to act black
I'll crack a cracker like I crack a plastic bag of Cracker Jacks
Pull up your bra, quit spillin' your guts
You better cork your bottle
You feelin' yourself, like jerkin' off to my tunes
You willin' to bet, I'll make a splash like potholes
After it rains, with your name just like a snot nose
You'll be runnin', tryin' to escape what's comin'
But the exit's blocked, you're fucked, oh to be a woman
There's only one Michael Wayne, there's only one Klever
As for the other white boy from Gadsden, psh, whatever
You're welcome, now take that petty diss and run with it
Fuck around and I'll surround you like circumferences
You build a house of hate around what I have brung to this
Game, I'll make that place your home
Like the Sons of Mumford did
Lame, I'm all the way up, woke, turnt
You think you flame, you all the way suck, choke, burnt
Bitch I'm on fire like holiday nuts, holdin' firm
You want the doe, I'm all the way buck, you'll learn
Hop in the backseat bitch, hip-hop is snoozin'
You could use an Uber, like a student pupil
I'm a teacher, reach ya hand for the ruler, I'ma bruise your ego
Abuse and move into the hall, against the wall, stupid
Who's the man? Who's the tutor?
Lead is flyin' 'til they dead or cryin'
The police are saying now, "Who's the shooter?"
Here I go, with a trench coat and a black rifle
Ten toes down up like a light pole
Middle finger up like a black rhino's horn
I was born for the storm, I'm at home in a shit cyclone
Never let bygones be bygones
Rather I'll say, "See ya later, adios," bitch
Rappin' obese is just bygone
Never thought the culture that I loved would be this sleazy
These videos all look alike, no wonder they can't see me
Is this the guy that said he was the hottest white boy
Since the one with dyed blonde hair? What the fuck?
Hold up, G—easy
I can't let this Tom Cruise-lookin' motherfucker just paddle by
Don't know if I'm watchin' Vanilla Ice or Vanilla Sky
Marshall Mathers may have ignored you
But if you want the smoke, bring the foil
I'll boil you 'til the kettle's dry
Have a nice day, suave
I'm a different breed, I'm a wolf, okay?
Got so many styles I could be a wardrobe, boy
So little boy flows some O.J. poured in the glass
With your buttermilk pancakes
Mama's little helper, Daddy's little bae
Put the Bébé Kids in my Chevrolet
Brought the pepper spray and a banana for AKs
Bitch, holler, "Mayday, mayday"
Then take it to the bank, it's another payday
Oh, you a baller? Well, take the ball and
Let me here kick that shit, Pelé
The nerve of the shit they say, I'm permanently amazed
And your whiskey sucks, fuckin' one sip
I wanted to go straight back to AA
Who else? I would diss Post Malone but he don't even rap
Fuck it, fuck Post Malone, just because
Let's see if he answers back
All that chain stitchin' from Chill Bill
And the cowboy boots and hats
Damn, Posty, can't we be friends?
Our clothes already match
Poser, biter, appropriation thief
Give a fuck how many records you sold
Every fan you made is a leaf off of my tree
Boy, you're my seed
Another mullet in the gang with the teeth icy
I just picked a bone with Post Malone
And did it all on a B-side beat
Dribble through the middle up
Crossover on 'em like I'm in the NBA
Look, I don't really give a fuck
Tell me, what do I gotta lose anyway?
Still mobbin' in the pickup
Throw a middle finger out the window when I wave
Trunk Muzik III, bruh, you gon' know how I feel about MGK
Beethoven is rollin' over in his grave
'Cause I'm a conductor and a conduit
Of musical energy, electrical wave
Prodigy of an anomaly, Shady
Bumpin' daily somethin' crazy, someone save me
Nothing made me somethin', baby
No one's playin', fuck you, pay me

I’m just a boy with a dream
That bet it all with the last bill that I had hid in my socks
Used to keep a .22 in a shoebox
Now I bang Beretta
She’s twenty-two and I keep her in a tube top
White trash and all
Take us all the way to the top and then laugh it off
Like how the fuck did I get a catalogue with more hits than a fucking jackhammer dog
Cause I planned it all
Crimson Tide standing tall
Shit, I’m another lit cannon ball
Fuck around and I’m going off and I’m getting throwed off
[Chorus: Kid Rock]
Yeah I’m throwed off
Ain't about the money I’ma blow it all
I made my own name
Let’s roll, let's roll
Yeah, I’m going off
Ain't got a whole lot but I’ma show it off
Better recognize game, lets roll, lets roll18Embed

Daylight

Daylight, woah daylight
Daylight, is coming again
Whiskey, woah whiskey
Whiskey, my only friend

[Verse 1]
Got me a bottle, lookin' out at my El Dorado
Smokin' a barro, whip up an egg and avocado
I'm on the porch like a slummy Ralph Lauren model
Flannel shirt like a lumberjack choppin' a log-o
Pistol next to the ashtray, no bow and arrow
Got blah blah though, knock the beef outcha top nacho
I'm livin' life like there is a tomorrow
I'm slow motion, I'm slow cookin'
The crock pot holds potatoes
I smell the storm comin', I like watching a sorrow
I like watching that muddy water fillin' up the potholes
I like hearing the woods cry, moan, whisper and sing songs
So I can think long; an aficionado
Raindrops on the string hit: a pizzicato
I'm free-fallin', the airplane pilot's on idle
Freezer lookin' like I hit the lotto
And I got beer colder than a Colorado hollow
Do you follow?

And just like the howlin' wolf
A couple sips down and it's nothin' but blues
Alcohol and rain, now that's what grown men do
You keep it one hundred, I keep a hundred proof
Cause when the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof
I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
Call me what you want but don't call past two
Unless you got some liquor to contribute
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
When the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof
I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
Call me what you want but don't call past two
Unless you got some liquor to contribute
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded

[Verse 2]
Drinkin' 'til I'm heavily faded
All the sudden the suds I'm sippin' got me feelin' edumacated
I complicate the uncomplicated
My drinkin' partners are the greatest
Me and my buddy, Jack Davis
Daniels, whatever, we Jimmy Beamin', if we get lucky, maybe
We get a visit from the baby King 13 and go fuckin' crazy
Ten racks for a crystal chandelier full of liquid swazy
Now Patsy Cline got me walkin' after midnight
I'm tippin' the neck, gotta make sure to keep the lid tight
Was sittin' up with attention and now I just sit like
Slump down in my chair like a pimp, pondering this life
I'm the great grandson of Otis Williams
Part of me's Cherokee, the other part is a pilgrim
So me and firewater's like splittin' me up the middle
One's tryin' to love him, the other one's tryin' to kill a man
[Hook]
And just like the howlin' wolf
A couple sips down and it's nothin' but blues
Alcohol and rain, now that's what grown men do
You keep it one hundred, I keep a hundred proof
Cause when the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof
I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
Call me what you want but don't call past two
Unless you got some liquor to contribute
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
When the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof
I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
Call me what you want but don't call past two

To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded

Row Your Boat
47 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisRow Your Boat LyricsYou said you don’t wanna die but still you want to go to heaven
Heaven’s not a place that you can scare me into changing everything that I believe in
Leavin’ what is keeping you from walkin’ out the door and livin’ life like there’s a reason
Reason is the fear of change will leave a person locked inside a dark and mental prison
Prisoners of war, the war is media, they feed to you graffiti up your vision
Visionary super scary future they will shoot ya’ they will loot ya’ they are killin’
Killin’ power of the power that exists above us is a problem - it’s a sentence
Sentence you to pull and push and jump, when they say jump you say how high
There is no limit
Limit what they sell and what they’re givin’

Even if the whole world knows
I don’t give a damn about what they think
I don’t have to stand up to your gun
I don’t have to sit down when you say
Tell me I’m overboard
The truth is you just want to see me sink
If there’s any room left on that ship
You don’t have to save any room for me
Cause I’ve got my own boat (even when it rains)
I’m doing my own thing (even when it rains)
And I will stay afloat - even when it rains
Cause i’ve got my own boat
Row, row your boat
Row, row your boat
Row your boat
You might also likeThey marchin’ up the street they wanna fight they don’t want peace
Peace of what you have they snatch and grab
They steal and run
They pullin’ guns out on police
Police they shoot and kill - they shoot at will
They will at you - they’ll execute if you don’t leave
Leavin’ the impression no one’s safe inside this dungeon in the city of the beast
Beasts are on the corner, slingin’ poison to the junkies - to a junkie it’s a feast
Feast or famine, come examine, take a look into that alleyway that’s on your street
Streets are not the only place that you can find yourself laying up under white sheets
Sheets in Alabama cockin’ hammers, ridin’ horses, wanna handle who is free
Free yourself from anything they preach

Even if the whole world knows
I don’t give a damn about what they think
I don’t have to stand up to your gun
I don’t have to sit down when you say
Tell me I’m overboard
The truth is you just want to see me sink
If there’s any room left on that ship
You don’t have to save any room for me
Cause I’ve got my own boat (even when it rains)
I’m doing my own thing (even when it rains)
And I will stay afloat - even when it rains
Cause i’ve got my own boat

Empty Bottles

Empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground
Silhouettes of people dancing
To an unfamiliar sound
Hello stranger, can I call you a friend?
My friend, I'm going down
With empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground

[Verse 1]
Brown bottle sits with the permanent bliss
Razor sharp glass lips, give me a kiss
Eyes fixated with a familiar shape
Black label, white letters, they integrate
Cupid's in the bar room with harpoons
I bloom in the night fog like mushrooms
See every bullet hole in the window of my past
Now that's what I call a shot glass (2, 3, 4)

Empty bottles on the table

Pack the cigarette box in my left palm

Blinded by the cameras pop flash
I'm a big fan, shot glass? (2, 3, 4)

You didn't know shit about me, man
You didn't go to school in the clothes that I had to wear back then
Look at you, fucking faggot, what you looking at, punk?
What, bitch? Give me another shot, hey, what you want?
Make it a double, fuck it, a triple, fuck it, give me the bottle
And then it's bottoms-up, what a positive role model

Hey wolf, wolf!

You used to be so cool, what the fuck happened to you?
Look at what all this rapping and money-stacking will do
I could've been stuck out in 'Bama, had I not flew the coop
And my babies would suffer Christmas cause Santa ain't got no loot
Uh, 'money ain't the issue' you said, that's funny now
Cause money's all I could give you to shut your motherfucking mouth
Here, take 20 grand and buy yourself a lawyer
Shit, here's a whip so my kids ain't gotta walk to the store for ya, fuck
Momma told me I should keep it real
My record ain't selling, momma, I'm trying hard enough to keep a deal
Meanwhile I'm throwing paper down into an empty pit
I got a business I'm trying to run, man, fuck this bitch
I should've seen it coming, she never pulled her weight
I'm carrying her like an elephant on a dinner plate
You gassed em, Yelawolf, you better pump your fucking brakes, asshole
You got the nerve to

[Hook 1]
Wanna talk about heartbreak, oh, oh
Baby, I've been around, you know I've been around
And I can't pretend to love you right now
So you can go cry your heart out until you drown
Hope you can swim it out cause I can't be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down

[Verse 2]
You got some nerve to be mad at me for, fuck, anything
What have I done besides give you what I could not afford?
The kids are happy cause they really don't know anything
If they only knew what toys that their momma could afford
The vacation they could be taking when daddy's on tour
Wait, you are on vacation, that's what this shit is for
I get it, I'm like the fountain of youth
You're in the bed with your boo and you two are sipping courvoisier, true?
This song ain't no diss, it's a living proof
Skit of skin and tooth, the witch in you bit, left me with cracked roofs
I ain't done, bitch, put this shit in loop
Here's a melody so it sticks in your head like your tracks do, ooh

In the head with a Whopper

Bitch you better pop in a CD of me immediately slut, ho

Oh, this is ugly boy swag
Putting toe tags on you motherfucking ho bags

And I’m in the zone now, everybody

Runnin' over motherfuckers like I’m in a bar
Sentimental motherfuckers in a cookie jar
Be the late night snack I’m Santa Claus
Down in Panama beach, drunk in my underalls
Playin' underwear volleyball with your broad
I ain't bothered by your triple D's, not at all
Let me hold em up for ya baby while you walk
Wanna get the party bumpin' let me do my thing
Get the marijuana plant need watering
Throw it in a bong let it start bubbling
Know what I mean, Butter bean, Badda Badda Bing
Trashy white, pass the mic, yeah I’m doin' em dirty
Fists start pumpin' when I’m in the lights, like I’m rappin' in Jersey
Never get elegant
In elementary, never learned to write in cursive
Raised by the country B-Boys, I’m elegantly perfect

Will I throw a dart at a wet seal
Well if I see a whale I’m a throw a fuckin' harpoon

Love Story

When this well runs dry
I guess you'll find another well
When I say goodbye
There'll be another breeze to sail
When my boat goes down
I guess you'll learn how to swim
If I don't come home
Just know you've been a good friend

[Hook]
Don't forget me
I love you so
Don't forget me
I've never let you go
Don't forget me
Love is the story I wrote
Don't forget me
Don't forget me

[Verse]
If God is my angel, the fucking devil's the pistol
Better put your face behind safety glass when I load up this missile
Whistling past this infinite path, I limp when I track
My footprints like a giant, look at this mountain
Bounce on my boots and then climb it
Mount up my troops and defiantly
Go against what they trying, teach 'em to shoot what I'm rhyming
Be living proof of my word, meaning I'm Bible designing
Jesus I'm rival, decapitating put the bait on my line and
Throw the hook to the open water
Fish till I catch that motherfucker
Looking for Megalodon, Goliath, Leviathan, I have been dying to find him and tie him to my boat and chop him up and dine with him on a plate with a steak and a coke
Rely on patience and hope, speak to a nation at shows
Reach through these speakers and grab you, turn the bass up and then choke
And I earned my place on this road, ain't nobody moving me, no way
No, how, OK, go, pow
When I was born they said exorcise and the hospital set on fire
The preacher got goosebumps when he saw me and said "Messiah"
Yea from the heavens, I have arose from the ashes of hell
Brought here to be poor white trash and excelled
Stuck in the woods of 'Bama, wood like math on the shelf
A scientist under development with nines and twelves and threes
And things like pyramids and fuck it you'll see
How I made a pot of gold from a bucket of beans
How I made it back to dry land, stuck in the sea
From crippled ships to triple dipped Z's 71's
Yeah it's already begun and I ain't even had a hit but I'm fuckin' ready for one
I got my weight up like I'm carrying fat people
I planned it, I landed
Touch down, that's eagle
But above all the guts glory it's more than just blood for me
My heart is half open for the ones that never gave a fuck for me
My love story
Oh (Yeah yeah)
Oh...
Oh (Yeah yeah)

Yelawolf and I feel like a king in my box Chevy
Tell them other wack muthafuckas to get they pine box ready
Catfish Billy is deadly, don't get slapped with the medley
Still sippin' on Jack D to my neck and my head start feelin' heavy
Doin' one-twenty five down I-29
Really think I need to start slowin' down
But I can't 'cause I got a pretty little blonde thing
Sittin' to my right that's blowin' me now
Oh yeah, she's headin' me
I think her name might be Becky
I was about to drop her off
But I had to switch lanes to get the brain she begged me
Aww naw, do you come in twos?
Please choose a couple of friends that could hop in and cruise
Now we goin' steady, but I'm not lookin' for longevity
Pipes in the back, the lights of the night reflect sights through the dash, I'm nice to ride pass

[Hook: Yelawolf]
My wheels are super clean, paint job it glitters and gleams
And I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
This whip is built for queens and you wanna be seen with a king
Well I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
Tilted off Jim Beam, sittin' low, to the side I lean
And I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats

Ridin' 85 northbound, shakin' doors down
So I turn the speakers louder, pissin' off polices
Fuck a five-star chick, got a pornstar bitch
Ridin' shotgun with me, gettin' so wet
Now she goin' down on me givin' roadhead
Bustin' on her forehead then I take her back to the homestead
Peace, back in the Caprice took a sack of weed
And crumpled it inside a cognac blunt wrap
Then it's time to jump back on the highway 85
Slumpin' in my seat like I'm hunchback
And my Chevy lookin' so dope
Old school Vogues on it got it floatin' like a rowboat
Gold flakes in the candy paint drippin' on the road
Drivin' slow like a mothafuckin' showboat, ho
Don't act like you don't hear me comin'
I got the Willis Drummond and it's comin' out the clarion
Twelves in the trunk, flatscreen TVs in the headrest with Something About Mary on, carry on
I be turnin' heads every time when you see me in the Chevy
Man, it's evident she car-struck
And I'm far from hard up so quit trippin' like a bitch
And get in the car, slut, girl you know you wanna ride

And I’m out lookin' for the ladies
Peanut butter seats have seat girl my peanut butter needs jelly
I'll chase you like Chevy if you ain't afraid to get messy
If you know the game then I'll let you call the shots like a referee
Now I’m drinkin' a deuce deuce, swig it slow
Feelin like I’m Deuce Deuce Bigalow
Pick a bitch like I pick a piccolo
Go anywhere you wanna go, pick a road

Twins pipes like pow-pow
Hundred spokes on the Vogues like wow, wow, wow

[Verse 1]
The windows cracked on the Chevrolet
My cigarettes in the ash tray
The engines off and the radio's down
So nervous my whole body shakes
The parking lot's full of people and
They ready to see the preacher man
Time to open up for the main act
I guess that makes me a deacon
I promise that I won't let me down
And check myself in the mirror one time
Say my prayer and then I sip the Crown
Light another smoke and step outside
Walk inside and take a look around
As I try to remember all of my lines
Guess it's time for me to face the crowd
And give the people my time

These people standing on front row
Tryna see through me like a window
I'm wearing my soul on my sleeve
But they look at me through a pin hole
All I see is this opportunity
To see at least one of you in me
But I can't seem to win 'em over so
I swallow the humility
Fifteen minutes to hold 'em down
And I'm just wishing that it would fly by
It's like my whole world hits the ground
All I wanted to do is have a good time
Hold me under but I will not drown
All I really know how to do is survive
Next time that I come to your town
I'll be the fuckin' headline

I'm not supposed to be this person, I suppose
I'm not supposed to be this rapper poking holes at stereotypes
Or to write this juxtaposing flow to beats at shows
I hold the microphone and out me goes this songs and quotables
Call me nasty, say I stink, well hit the sink and hold your nose
Cause I'm about as convinceable as a bum in stolen clothes to let go of those
I got dreams like fish got gills
I can't survive in this lake water without a deal
But I can build Noah's Ark without a power drill
Look at this crowd like it's a battlefield
Tell 'em my trials, my triumphs, my failures, my family loud and clear
Let 'em all judge, I don't care how they feel
Fuck it, what do I care? I'm my personal shrink
Throw my heart down on the ground, stomp it, use the blood for the ink
I'm used to purple and pink bruises so thanks for the tools
That's just a brick from the mansion
Another stitch in the pants of a Johnny Cash

Hard White (Up In The Club)
70 ContributorsHard White (Up In The Club) Lyrics[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
You ain't gotta lay down on your back
To know you already fucked up
Letting me in the muthafuckin' game is like
Letting me drunk drive in ya truck
When Yelawolf arrived in this club, already had 5 in my cup
Then I took another hit and I run into a bitch
That's looking lifeless and stuck
Baby, what's wrong with you now?
What, you ain't happy with Red Bottoms?
Mad cause I'm in VIP with a fuckin' Jack bottle?
With Tom, Dick and Harry
I got up in this bitch with a tank top cause I spit so very, darn quick and scary
That's why they're so quick to compare me
But fuck my critics with a spiked dick
When it can fit barely. They probably think I'm a Limp Bizkit
That spits jelly, when I put them in the woods I'm a redneck
I'm a hick? Tell me: go ahead, yeah!
What the fuck does it matter to me?
Cause after me there'll only be wannabes
And mostly ain't never gonnabes
Yeah in this forest I'm a lonely tree
My limbs are covered in tattoos -and my roots they run deep

[Chorus 1]
I'm 2 bottle shawty, 2 bitches waiting
Two 10's: that's a "win-win situation"..
Happy birthday, I'm feelin' brand-new
Drinks on me! For ME: not you

I don't know what to say after that first verse
I mean like damn, I just killed it
What the fuck am I supposed to do with this cow?
I done already milked it
Smoke another cigarette unfiltered
Let go of anything that I’m feelin’
They done broke me down so many times before
That I'm no longer rapping I'm building
With one brick, two brick, three brick, four
Underneath the steps of my single wide door
Raised by them dope boys, so I know how them thangs look
Thanks for the recipe: rest in peace, Wayne Bush
I don't cook my shit, I don't break it down for you muthafuckas
Out there waiting around for some rap savior
You better look up at what it is that you facing now
Cause Jesus drives a Harley, the Devil wears Prada
If God was one of us, he'd probably drink vodka
I still kick it at the party when I get rich
Cause rich or broke, I'm still as dope
The realest ain't as real as this
Dead or alive, I'll put a stamp in this bitch
You'll never seen rock and roll do hip-hop like I did
[Chorus 1]
I'm 2 bottle shawty, 2 bitches waiting
Two 10's: that's a "win-win situation"..

A pretty bouquet and a red rose

Darling, don't cry

I will take your favorite books, and put them in a row
I remember how you like them, I know where they go
Your mama will be waiting there, for you to hold
I know that she misses you, misses you so

So have a great flight
Have a great flight outta here, I suppose
I know you raised me right, but you must go, I suppose
You have a great flight
Have a great flight outta here, I suppose
I know you raised me right, but you must go, I suppose

I will keep the memories, that always make me smile

Like a raven over the grave, I get lost over the page
I'm in tune with my spirit, doing shrooms, trip for days
Eighteen with the plats, in the projects with the raps
White boy with the blacks, from the sticks, I crossed the tracks
Rock and roll, rolling stone, daddy left his pistol home
Load it up, shooting bottles off the porch to his songs
I was troubled, I was hurt and it bubbled to the surface
Took it out on writing songs, put that seed up under the dirt
God gave me water (Bless,) two sons and one daughter (Bless)
I prayed and prayed harder (Now I) work hard and play harder, I
Visualize, put thumbtacks over outlines
And when they said I was out of my mind I put more goals in the pipeline, this is my time

[Chorus]
To get everything I wanted in this lifetime
I had to put my beliefs on the front line

Well fuck 'em if he don't take it well
So crack the top off that hot, shaking ale
And say "Free Young Struggle" who's not making bail
He got popped by the feds
Fuck the cops! Take an L
Fuck it take M-N-O-P, learn how to spell

Walkin' through the mall, actin' like a prick again
You had a halter top, I had my famous socks
You came to shop, I came to ho hop
You had your girl with you, both lookin' great
I wanted both of y'all, how 'bout a double take
She was hatin', lookin' at me like a scumbag
But something made you wanna turn around and come back
Probably cause I just don't give a fuck
I just wanna' see one of these hookers in my truck
So tell your girlfriend "tough luck"
She just wanna see you with somebody dressed up
Well, I really ain't into that type of shit
I'm into tattoos, drinkin' til 6
Fuckin' til 9, sleepin' til 12

This shit should've been finished
I'm as surprised as you are that you still let me in it
But you continue to text message me
Right after sayin' that we should both move separately
But you don't wanna see me go
Even though I'm only givin' you dick and cold cereal
So you must have a thing for Lucky Charms
Or the bad girl in you just fell in my lucky arms
You love to cuss me out and call me crazy
Say I'm no good and all of your friends hate me
Then you show up to my room and damn near rape me
And then it goes from "fuck you" to "fuck me baby"
You leave early so nobody sees you out the spot
Now you stuck between a hard place and a rock
You call me a player but I have lied to you not
Cause I'm not a player, I just crush a lot
Holler!

How can someone like me so bad get such a good girl

Some dude was talkin' shit, I had to whip his ass
Called you in the mornin' and you just fuckin' laughed
You think this cute, you love my crazy ass
And I wonder if you'll ever leave my side
Cause the more that I ignore you, the more you wanna ride
I tell you that I'm bad but you never ask why
Cause you just want the good from a really bad guy
You wanna rock, let's rock and roll, just know
I'm only good at one thing and that's not control
But I am consistent, that's somethin' to be proud of
Cause I ain't shit with you and I ain't shit without you

That's a long time away
Daddy, you gonna tell her what Ma said?

[Verse 1]
I've been that boy since I was smoking banana peels
Back in Alabama with the ball-pen
Hammer knocking hubcaps off the wheels
Stealing bowties off the grills
Mama said, "No carbonated soda 'fore you go to bed"
But I never listened to her
A two-liter bong with a tinfoil bowl
Full of cheap hydro is illegal, I'm sure
But I learned from watching the neighbors
Yeah, watching the neighbors
Got me in Jordache jeans
Feeling real hot, hangin' from my pocket, a pager
Yeah, buddy boy, I'm clean
Cubic zirconium rocks in my earrings
Give me that stone and a mobile phone
And I carry that gem like me and Irene
I'm getting totally stoked
Sipping Creek Water with me and my folks
I'm getting totally throwed
My flock is waddling around
Can't keep my ducks in a row
And I can't keep up with this bullshit they callin' dope, but I'm married to her
I can't leave this bitch neither
Rock and roll pussy I cannot turn down
Even though she's a liar, a thief, and a cheater, I need her

Catfish Billy
That motherfucker Billy in the house
Billy and I'm really in the house
Really like I'm really on the couch
Choppin' up dope, boy, I ain't never seen a drought
You ain't never seen a Catfish Billy
There'll never be another from the South
Never be a mother with the style
To make another me, not now
The King of Alabama, that ain't never been a doubt, just bounce
I'm Catfish Billy
That motherfucker Billy in the house
Billy and I'm really in the house
Really like I'm really on the couch
Choppin' up dope, boy, I ain't never seen a drought
You ain't never seen a Catfish Billy
There'll never be another from the South
Never be a mother with the style
To make another me, not now
The King of Alabama, that ain't never been a doubt, just bounce

[Verse 2]
Still got the bottom beating like gorillas
Checking my trunk like a killer
You ain't fucking with Slumerican, stop, uh
Bitch, go to sleep, grab a pillow
Go to sleep with your stinking ass
I ain't got time, I ain't taking trash
Out to the bin, take you out with my pen
And then I take a bottle and break the glass (Ooh)
I done built me a fortress
And I didn't have to beg, plead, or force it
Got enough forces to sit on my porch and not move, and still be in orbit
An ancient alien, homo sapien
Me and rap is like bee to orca
Turn water to wine, one dollar a time
Drink it up, it's fine, there's no need to cork it
Gorgeous, mmh, give me those
'Cause I remember me and mama poppin' penny rolls
And if you wasn't with me when the shit hit the fan
Then you cannot get a penny, you ain't getting any, bro
Gotta pay the taxes when the wood is out
And the kerosene can is filled up to the brim
Don't look at him, go get the matches
Lace up and then take a hike
I'm making shit that is major like
I'm pulling up on them big wheels
You couldn't pedal a baby bike
I do not hang at the same club in the same town every damn night
I am not making hip-hop for the hip-hop award show or the 'Gram likes
Cause I'm...

These donuts are delicious... son of a bitch! We got a 10-94 on Hines Road, requesting backup. Repeat, 10-94 on Hines Road heading southbound. I'm in pursuit!

[Verse 1]
Pick up, pick up, daddy's in the pickup
Got so much bounce the kick drum give me the hiccups
You don't want it with me, sucker, just look up
Beer flyin' in this mothafucka like bird shit
Ran these Mickey Thompsons up on the curb, bitch
Crook as a picture on Sunday
My maniac Slumerican squad mount up around your Hyundai
Chevy's up, we got low lives and bow ties
Up shit's creek, I'll take you for a boat ride
Stick his head in the water, now let him flap his lips
Motormouth, make a wave, yeah, Roll Tide
You're playin' golf in lightning? So am I
Dressed in a tin man suit
Drinkin' a tin can too, that is 110 proof, uh
Man if I only had a heart for you bitches
I'd get down on my knees and help you dig them ditches
But mama only raised Hell
So when you're done diggin' that ditch, bitch, bury yourself, boaw
Pass me that Colt .45
I'm partyin' 'til my fuckin' throat sore and dry

I'm goin' down

Hey, daddy, all around the town they're sayin'
"He's goin' down, Lord, have mercy"

[Verse 2]
Uh, You drivin' drunk, better lift your seat up
Cause cops pull us over just to fuckin' meet us
Cause Marshall's a Rap God, damn right
Well, then I guess that makes me Jesus
So turn this water to whiskey
Watch the dirty south go from dirty to filthy
High class only means stoned in school
Joints rolled up bigger than pony stool
Smoke, stains on the roof of the old Regal's brown
So what I got spokes on this bitch, and?
The lift kicks like climbin' into a spaceship
UFO's, unidentified flyin' Oldsmobiles
And mobile homes, amen
I can still smell the kerosene leakin'
I should've seen the signs, I was blowin' up
Either in a trailer home or a pickup
Hey, Bubba, your baby boy is in big trouble
I fuckin' ran through a briar patch and got cut up
Now I'm wide open in front of the whole town
I bled for the game, I guess it's obvious now
I'm goin' down now, he told me wear it with pride
You wanna take the hard road you gotta cherish the ride
Most mothafuckers won't jump to embarrass the fly
Can't build a legacy up, then let it perish and die
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm goin' down
[Chorus]
Aw, man, you gotta love it
I'm on my way

And take away the stars, cause you light up the night
Feel as high as the moon
When you’re here with me
That's why I'm gonna write your name
For the world to see

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Another old man on the porch with the bottle
Wind blows and the old rockin' chair wobbles
He's just the wavin', everybody's welcome
All he can say about the youth is Lord help 'em
Got a couple grand babies, but they never call though
Left him in the south and they moved to Chicago
Wife's in heaven and, hes saying ever since
Vietnam life's been hard as a veteran
Simple life, just a six pack, yeah ice cold
Across the Georgia line for a ticket for the lotto
Probably never see his name in the headlines
But if I had a plane, I'd put it in the sky
Alabama

Jimmy's not a man and he can’t provide you
He doesn’t want to, but you keep it anyhow
Nine months down the road, what you gonna' do now

May never be the first string on a championship team
You may be the star the world just hasn't seen

Being rich is only realising it's all a facade
You’re richer than you think in that old small town
Cause people like you make the world go round

Change
41 ContributorsChange Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yela done found his touch a long time ago
Had to walk hours before I found this new kind of road
Had to spend months inside a dark room with my candle broke
But I came out with a light that blinded the antelope
Oh I mean a buck, 'cause I'm buckin' the antidote
Could I be what they though I was, but it's kinda no
And it's kinda yes when addressin' my talent growth
They seen a star but I got life like a planet though
I was just a bud and who knew what the plant would grow
Flowers and I got flower power like Abbey Road
I caught the sun shower drenched in a pot of gold
Bless you with this twinkling powdered smoke
The wind got in my sails in the creek water, no paddle boat
Nobody pickin' me off the ground when my saddle broke
It don't matter though, a horse is a horse
Plus I needed the workout, I'm kinda glad it broke
I'm ecstatic, better yet, I'm in that kind of mode
That classics are made from

Yeah that's me, with a fifth of that Jack D
Still ridin' dirty to 8-ball MJG
Still got the house in the little hood that raised me
Still know dope boys, I talk to 'em daily
Still got that red neck family who loves me
Still hop out of trucks in the heart of Dixie
Don't try to pull me back, or apart from my history
Because I'm creative, smart and thrifty
'Cause I'll take a shotgun of PBR's no sippin'
Jump in the Chevy do some Catfish Billy trippin'
Hop on the 808, when I flip then you know I'm flippin'
Never gave a fuck about the lines I cross 'em, I'm playing chicken
Raised in the Bible Belt, but with the cross I was made a Christian
What's up world? I'm in Alabama chillin'
And I just took a shot for the ones who stop when they hit the ceilin'
Drop the top on the 65 in Nash, I can still hear em, they're saying

[Hook 2]
(Where will you go now? What will they say?)
I done found my soul through change

[Outro]
Do not succumb to the masses ideas
Over ridicule and judgement
For those who follow the ideas of the weak
Will perish in a dim fog of enlightenment
Become the vision of the mind's eye
And carry your flame to the fire
Do not wait for the fire to carry the flame to you
Build, work, build, work, build, work
Fall down, fail, learn, learn, earn, earn and conquer
Money is a tool for the creation of a creative space
Do not squander the value of a gift from a friend
Family, strangers, enemies, atheists, partisans, pedlers, people
People in this ocean of hungry minds
Feed, do not starve
Start now, wake up
A trillion more lives will live happy before one of those trillion care or not about your happiness
Love yourself and hate only you
If you don't...17Embed

Gangster
43 ContributorsGangster Lyrics[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
There must’ve been something about my careless upbringing
That got me into so much trouble at school and shit
Could’ve been the drugs at home, maybe I was just a foolish kid
I soaked up everything that I could from the people that stayed at my house
Biker gangs, waking up to people that I didn’t know crashed out on my couch
Really didn’t know at the time, that I didn’t have a normal life
And when I took that attitude to a new neighborhood I had to learn to fight
And respect from the kids like me was immediately minority
I guess it must’ve been that “I don’t give a fuck about none of y’all” shit that sorted me
Out from the rest of the haves, and the have-nots took me in as kin
Outcast, poor white trash, and that’s where I learned to make my friends
But I’ve always been a weirdo to my homie cause I wanted to go be an entertainer
He was selling rock out his window
I was the rapper and my best friend was a...

[Hook: Yelawolf]
Gangster, gangster, gangster
Aye, what we gettin’ into tonight?
Step into the ride, lookin’ through the eyes of a motherfuckin’
Gangster, gangster
So, am I gonna risk my life, to ride?
You're motherfuckin’ right
When your best friend is a gangster

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Danger, we pistol banging, another homicide
Rollin’ in the Chevy, motherfucker, ride or die
Ridin’ in the scraper low, it shake from side to side
If the paper low, his burner on his side, murder on his mind
Only 21 and still he strives to stay alive
Feelin’ paranoia, too much pride to stay inside
Ain’t no time to wait around, find the safest place to hide
Drop a chopper, lay you down, it’s the fastest way to God
Grandmama tell him “Son, you gotta pray to God”
Gamble with your life and then you gotta pay the price
Place your bet and roll the die, thank the Lord and pray to Christ
‘Cause you almost spent your life livin’ as a young motherfuckin’…

Do it by myself, I don’t need no help

Big Henry, bitch – nobody else
Ten toes down, march nigga, step!
If I pop that trunk I’mma pop me a chump
Leave a nigga slumped with his chin in his chest
Bang, bang, bang, nigga, real G shit
Half of these rappers ain’t live like this
On behalf of the streets I live like this
Nobody really knows why it is like this
When it comes to a buck, I’m a mathematician
Go and hit the block like a car collision
Niggas talkin’ money, you ain’t starvin’, is ya?
You start to lose weight like there's poison in ya

To load a .22 and take it to the woods and let it ring
Into the night and break a bottle with the bullet
Yes I'm 'bout it motherfucker, not a single solitary thing
Is missin' from my southern roots I'm liable just to take a Chevrolet
And run it through the mud for giggles
Huh, what a son of a bitch my momma raised into a rapper
Who could tell a story like my uncle when he's drinkin'
Product of a workin' environment, fuck is y'all thinkin'?
Meanin' I'm workin'-workin' harder than any artist
Can ever do it simply 'cause I'm made that way
I build a house around your ass before you could realize
That you in the neighborhood that Yelawolf made
So call me a redneck and tell your boys about it
Tell 'em I'm an Alabama wanna-be, I be that
I'll just take it to the studio
And drop a bomb on you from a motherfuckin' beanbag
I need that...

Get away, tell my folks roll up the J’s
Bring Yelawolf a deuce, we’ll sit up on the roof of the broken Chevrolet

Trailer park's on fire, Billy been cookin' up somethin'
If you need a biscuit, come on then
Billy has got it jumpin' get it from a pro
Get it for the low, get you some blow
Get it for the nose, get it for the show
Get it for the hoes, four wheeler cranked up
Gas tank on the ATV
It's full of that crank but, Billy got pills from A to Z
So what do you think bud, Billy won't go below fifty
Twenty-two's are dangerous
Drink a finger with the nugget rings
Pow, take one from the needle, how you feelin' now
Purple moons and lucky charms, yeah that's the sound
Of veins turnin' brown, but his fame is so profound
His name is like a noun, they going Billy now

[Refrain]
Billy's on the corner with the Crystal Meth
And he ain't slowing down, slowin' down
Billy's on the corner with the Crystal Meth
Go Billy
C-c-c-c-Crystal Meth

[Verse 2]
Hello junkie and hello Momma too
Hello to my P.O, deuce up to the boys in blue
Billy got brass balls
Twenty pounds on the catwalk
LSD and Adderall
And LCD's on the wall
He's watchin' every move
High-tech Redneck
Run up on him if ya want to
I bet redneck, c'mon
It might be dark in the woods
But the lights are on
The money's counted
And if the price is wrong
Well then Billy will get them Gremlins like Spielberg
He'll take your house down, off of them pillars
And take your Mom to Sizzler
And feed her chicken liver
That's cold blooded love
Billy's a chiller

[Verse 3]
4:30 in the A.M
Billy ain't slept for days
Gotta keep up with the profit
Gotta keep up with the craze
It's a heavy shade
Gotta walk through the maze
Down where the sun don't shine
And the pine trees sway
And when the wind blew
And the cradle fell
Down come baby Billy
And up come an able male
Momma stayed at work
Daddy stayed in jail
Hey that's a full deck
But ya gotta play with what your dealt
So Billy dealt the joker
Put the sheriff in a choker
He drank himself sober
And pissed in a Super Soaker
And he wet 'em all up
And left his snow yellow
That's hard White Boy
For the L O

Disappear
54 ContributorsDisappear Lyrics[Verse 1]
Daddy I've been thinkin' about you lately
Mama's never here and step daddy hates me
He drinks a lot, it makes him so mean
Mama always screams and it gives me bad dreams
Today I dropped my bowl of s'ghetti on the floor
I didn't mean to make a mess, I tripped on one of my toys
I tried to clean it up, really I tried
But I just made it worse so I went to my room to hide
I knew if Benny saw it I'd be in so much trouble
I didn't want to, but I did
And the thought of gettin' hit scared me so I didn't tell him
Benny saw it, he took off his belt and
You know... he hit me with it
Then he pushed my face in to the carpet where the s'ghetti spilted
But I forgive him though
I love you daddy, I guess I gotta go

[Hook]
There's a moth on my window sill
And it came to die alone
Through the pain of the pouring rain
I gaze into the storm
And I imagine I'm the son of a man
Who will hold me close and near
With these bruises on my face I cry
While I pray to disappear

Daddy are you there?
I know you're probably busy off working somewhere
Helpin' somebody, build a house or somethin' neat
You told me what you did, carpentry, right?
Man, that's so cool, daddy
I really miss you, so much that I would kiss you
Yeah even front of my friends
I guess you know I'm gettin' sick again
I've been throwin' up, I haven't been playin' much
I missed a lot of school this week, but I'm tough
I'll make it, you know me, daddy
I don't get what I want most of the time but I'm patient
Hey if you get a second
Maybe tomorrow you could come by just to check in
Because my babysitter's crazy
Mama don't believe me but she makes me get naked
And I'm embarrassed so I hide it
I'm tellin' you because you know my heart and what's inside it
I gotta go to sleep but don't turn off the lights
I love you daddy, or should I say Christ?
I gotta go to sleep but don't turn off the lights
I love you daddy, or should I say Christ?

[Hook]
There's a moth on my window sill
And it came to die alone
Through the pain of the pouring rain

While I pray to disappear
[Outro]
When the weeping willow tree sways from the breeze
I float away
To the end of the world, to the moon, to the stars
To the heavens where I'm safe
I’m a child, not a prey. I’m an angel, enslaved
I'm a life, I'm a world, I'm a rose, put to waste
Wake me up, let me live, let me breathe, let me breathe
Give me love, give me soul, give me guidance, give me peace

The Last Song
30 ContributorsThe Last Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
Everybody's askin' me lately where I'm from
They wanna know what I've been through and what dirt I've done
But man if I told you what I've seen and been through then you probably run off
That your scared of the truth so its dead and secret lined in chalk
See I've been lost ever since I could walk
Looking for my daddy in anyone of mamma's boyfriends who would talk
Or listen to me when I spoke instead of lookin' at me like a joke
Or leavin' me behind leavin' me to cry when you treated my momma like a ho
But I learned quick that my daddy wasn't ever gonna come around
And I didn't give a shit cause me and my momma we held it down
No new kicks first day of school I'm goodwill bound
But when you come from the trench that's how you learn to walk around
So I don't give a fuck if you ever lay eyes on top of my new shoes homey
I just wanted you to know I didn't need a dollar from you I got 'em myself
So if you find yourself in the middle of the floor with the bottle drinking yourself lonely
Then you can keep company with the picture of me in the magazine on the shelf turn the page

[Hook]
Daddy can you see me? I'm putting on a show
In the magazines hear me on the radio
So what do you think huh?
(I hope that you're proud now
To watch it all go down)
I'm sorry daddy you didn't get to watch me grow
Now I'm always on the road no time to say hello
Bye (I hope that you're proud now
To watch it all go down)

Yeah mamma you look great...perfect
Be safe on your first date...for certain
If he brings you home too late... I'll hurt him
Don't worry bout me I'm safe, I'll close the curtains
And I feel like I'm raisin' you but what do I know baby blue
All I know is that I was made in you so I put all my faith in you
Yeah I was only ten but I felt like a man and I had to let you go
All I wanted was for us to be rich tear drops in my cereal bowl
So I turned into an asshole young and dumb smokin' weed
Vandalizing, robbing houses, stealing cars, that was me
But everything I did I had to see, feel the pain, had to grieve
To become who I am and I'm proud of the man I came to be
What I've learned cannot be taught, what I've earned cannot be bought
Justified deserve it all, so don't be concerned it's not your fault
I never counted sheep I count my blessings
So if you see him now momma don't give him the cold shoulder just give him my message
Just tell him

[Hook]
Daddy can you see me? I'm putting on a show

To Whom It May Concern
45 ContributorsTo Whom It May Concern Lyrics[Intro]
So I had a phone call with a good friend of mine the other night
And, um
Seems that I’ve created some confusion
He told me straight up
"People don’t know you like I do, man"
I guess I haven’t said enough
Or maybe I’ve said too much, I don’t know
But I don’t wanna leave any stone unturned
Or no questions about who I am
Or what I represent
So here you go…

[Verse]
I grew up in the deep gutter
Raised by wolves, church steeples, and a single white mother
Taught to be blind to any colour by hippies who been smoking weed since the ‘60s
With Dukes of Hazzard for bed covers
Rock’n’roll, country music, and cocaine
One hand on the Bible and the ouija board in the other
The irony of it all is so thick that a fly would get stuck in the thin air of that dope smoke
Lynyrd Skynyrd and Michael Jackson
Practicing moonwalking with a broomstick in the kitchen, popping and locking
No BET on television, we didn’t have it, we had the rabbits
The tin foil, Mason jar on the counter full of bacon oil
Now looking back, talking ‘bout freedom, yeah you were spoiled
Oblivious to the hideous crimes from the insidious minds
That took place right below us on the Southern soil
The blood and the pain left a recoil
The creekwater’s holding secrets
Ghosts of Confederate veterans in the wind
Backwoods are haunted with the death and the sin
Slave ships carried the lost souls
Wicked white men slaughtering angels for a fucking bar code
We buried these wicked ways, the world is still turning
And these motherfuckers with they crosses is still burning
Yeah, I seen ‘em at the courthouse
Not really sure what they’re trying to prove still
Jumped up on mountains they’re still trying to move hills
And their daughters probably listen to Dru Hill
Pussy hotter than blue steel for Dru Hill
So Jesus come take the wheel
No, you steer drunk
The youth here’re punks
The truth here it come
I’ll show you how these country folks pop that trunk
Uh, and my honesty is modest
To tell the whole truth yeah I’ve pondered and I’ve pondered
To be spit at and called a wigger from who you considered a father at 14
‘ll make you wonder, and you wonder
Yeah, that’s hard to hear, ain’t it
But at that very moment my picture got painted
Call it God, call it what you will
But I knew the South was sick still and in need of some changes
So I took it upon myself to adopt all the outcasts
I took the American and the Confederate flag
Threw it in my back pocket, I even went and got tatts
And carried them like a shield for the shit that once held me back
And these redneck brothers of mine, playin’ that 3.6
In a fucking cornfield, in big trucks with lift kits
Oblivious to the beauty of juxtaposition
They had no idea how special it was to witness
Them in deep Alabama playing Snoop and Group Home
Big Hank and Metallica, I discovered a new zone
And Catfish Billy, a way for me to talk about it
From them on I was questioned and highly doubted by my peers
Who didn’t understand that all these years we’d been the brunt of the jokes
America made it clear that we were backwards, wrong, behind, and segregated
So I decided that Yelawolf would go make it more obvious that we’ve grown
I polished up my tone, I signed to Shady and brought a record deal home
Look mama, no hands, I’m coming up, yeah I’m grown
Respect from the OGs, cosigning my songs
First it was Bun B, then Raekwon, and TIP
Then all of these MCs wanted features from me
But I was a live wire, my tongue was a fuckin’ blade to these critics
Who didn’t get it, the clips from the grenade in my teeth
A little too unique, the market for me was smaller than some thought it would be
Even me so I looked in the mirror
Saw the Jordans, the gold chain, my shirt—Pantera
Rebel flag in my pocket, RED tattooed on my neck
Heart of Dixie across the stomach and it ain’t clicked yet?
Maybe I wore the wrong shoes back to the woods because these suede No. 5s can’t get wet
Maybe it’s something I need to go figure out on my own
So after Radioactive I took my shit back home
Disappeared from the world, became increasingly different
Tuned in every once in a while to see who was spitting
But mainly I was in Nashville getting back to my roots
Explorin’ music with Love Story, I made it my truth
Dropped a single called Til It’s Gone and travelled the globe
I started seeing rebel flags everywhere at my shows
I didn’t think nothing of it, I assumed that they get it
I’m on some New South shit, but I have to admit it
I saw the posts up on Instagram proclaiming I’m racist
And that I’m fucked in the head and I don’t know where my place is
I started taking it personal ‘cause I treat people equal
Homie, I got mixed kids and music is how I feed ‘em
Lo and behold as I’m saying this I discover this evil
White boy went in a church and killed 9 innocent people
Goddamn, hold on, moment of silence
[Verse 2]
Nine innocent church going people get murdered
There’s not a word I can utter, there’s not a rhyme I can say
There ain’t no fixing that ever, those people brutally slain
And I refuse to see ways to justify all the blame
That motherfucker’s insane
I got so mad at my own image, I took down merch
No explaining it now, it’s only making it worse
This fucking coward, this criminal’s, just a puppet, a mental case
But the truth is the truth, he did it because of race
There’s nothing I can describe, the shame that I felt inside
A white boy with the flag committed this homicide
I tried so long to defend the South, and yes it was my decision
My interviews broke on the internet, you can see my vision
I never thought myself to be like a politician, just a witness to the sickness
The kindling was in the bridge and the bricks that I laid to the road
That I built from the love and the wisdom
I’m trying to find my way
But now I’m feeling imprisoned from the stereotypes
I was prepared for the fight
Hell, I’ll be stereotyped until my burial site
I married a loaded gun when I married this mic
Ain’t playing Russian roulette, ain’t playing ‘round with my life
‘Cause what I cannot lose is the respect that I’ve gained
Friendships I cherish, fuck the money and fame
Black American culture is in the thread of my veins
It’s rock’n’roll till I die, I’m just a rebel in shame
Yes I apologize for me and anybody with that flag
Honestly, any proud Southerner is sad
How do you think I feel when I look at my grandad
Imagining him dead because of that piece of trash
I got nephews, nieces, who need this, peace between this
But media is fiendish
So if you feel like you’re above it or beneath it
Have a logical mind about who your team is
And when you look at me, dawg, don’t look at me like another branch off a tree
Lord, I took this shit and balanced it the best that I could
Try to hold up the wood of America’s old see-saw
But this ain’t Hee Haw with MeMaw
We ain’t on the Cosby Show, are we, bro
Daddy may give a goodnight kiss, but I can promise you this
That you ain’t promised tomorrow
I wish I could go back to the innocence
I remember my friends with no differences
But pigment is relative, isn’t it
Maybe by 2050 we’ll be over it
Big KRIT, I love you homie, keep killin’ shit
You inspired this verse, I got your back and that’s limitless
It is what it is, we cannot fix all this ignorance
Slumerican flags up, it’s over, I’m ending thisYou might also like26Embed

Why is everything I love the most, so wrong for me?
And everything I’m holding close, is so far away from me?
They don’t want me to lie but, they don't wanna' hear the truth
It never made sense to me
Why everything I love the most, is so wrong for me!

[Verse 1]
Yeah! Problematic, I’m so problematic
That I’m probably a problem addict
Pop an aspirin cause my head is hurtin'
Hotel bedroom, missin' curtains
Sheets everywhere like a storm has passed
In fact it looks like I got into a wrestlin' match
Empty bottle of Jack, I could tell I did that
I could smell it in fact, it's like death and ass
Think for a minute if I look over and look
To my left is an opened book, a Bible
To my right is a guilty conscience and her name is Brooke, my rival
At least I think her name was Brooke
She’s asleep, and I’m givin' her the lamest look
Move her hair back so that I could see your face
Cause it was dark and I met her at the game it took
About 5 minutes to get her inside the whip
Another 5 minutes to get up inside the lips
Never try really man, I really tried to slip, out
But it was just thighs and hips
OK, I was high, shit
On alchohol and the Yelawolf ego trip
Leave her lying in bed cause I don’t need no kiss
And it’s the walk of shame again!

[Verse 2]
Smokin’ hot, throw it up
Keep a fifth off in my cup
Trying not to be a simp
But every time I take a sip
I think I’m gonna fall in lust
I'm back and forth like I'm packing a truck
In a house that never runs out of boxes
Knowing that if I put on my tennis shoes
And a fresh fit, I’ll end up sockless
By the end of the night, flip flopping
I’ll B-Boy if you let me Hip Hop in
Alligator skin cowgirl boots only means let’s get it crockin’
That mini skirt makes any man a flirt
Manicures, animal furs and a purse
What could a little bit of smoke and Henny hurt?
You make any jerk make a penny work
Sinister with sin in her
She can leave a devil sitting in the church
On another level, not in the earth
Jessica Alba had twins at birth
Trippin' sure, piles of E, ménage-a-trois, piles of three
Waking up again, not proud of me
Yeah, I'm a lousy fiend
[Chorus]
Why is everything I love the most, so wrong for me?
And everything I’m holding close, is so far away from me?

Who you thought it would be?
Damn right, and I’m on a tightrope
Screaming out loud, "Bitch, fuck my life!"

Let me throw a bullet in the clip for luck, for us

Used to watch my beeper chirp, blue dickies and a black Raiders Shirt
My world was a little-bitty spot in the universe outside of Earth
Tennessee bound, Alabama born, I came down in a meteor storm
Media wrong, media write, right ‘em a wrong, ring the alarm
Duck under your desk, children go, this building is about to blow
I don’t know what I’mma do with this feeling inside of my mind and soul
I’m a one-in-a-million human show
Should've been the motherfucking Truman Show
But if you seen me getting raped as a child
You probably wouldn’t give me room to grow
Heavy blow, take a heavy sigh
Like a runner on the daily, he's high, oh my
We’ll be good, baby boy, don’t cry
I can make a boat with a book of rhymes
God made me the Cherokee like no
I can’t let the world off the hook this time
And if you didn’t want this Catfish shit
Then bitch, you should've never shook that line
Readied that hook, took this time, to press play then rewind
I would rather be drunk than be blind
To the space-age pimp shit that I combine
With what I know, rock-and-roll
I’m so famous, Country Fresh
That I can’t take one step in the fuckin’ street when I’m in public
So I get in them...
[Chorus]
Cinnamon seats, bass boat flakes, yeah, sprayed out
Drunk as a fool, throwing that Jim Beam back until I’m laid out
Homie, I’m on my Catfish Billy shit, I’m talking way out
Dude, I’m way out, I’m talking way out
Rolling country side anywhere that I go, hey now
Trunk on 'quake, cops pulling up they telling me “turn it way down”
Homie, I’m on my Catfish Billy shit, I’m talking way out
Dude, I’m way out, I’m talking way out7Embed

Hard White (Remix)
59 ContributorsHard White (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: T.I.]
Guess, who's, back, home!

[Verse 1: T.I.]
G shit, certified, nigga can’t touch him
Bosses all love him, haters, well fuck them
Bought cribs everywhere, everything custom
"Lun-bun-ton", bougie bitches like "What’s them?"
Solitaire clear stones, Maybach: clear dome
Blowing on that loud-pack, bankroll's full-grown
Well-known convict: go on with the dumb shit
Thug life with it, like it tatted on my stomach
Nigga better pick another number because I am not the one
The bigger picture's what's important before all is said and done
I bet I get this shit back up under my feet
Bullshit aside, what I want, I keep
I’m the big bad wolf, and I want my sheep
Your birthday cake, I want my piece
I’m beefing with MCs if, to me
It seems they’re less than decent
I’m a beast, then you’re my feast
Apologies, you just can't keep it
Say you’re winning?
Guess you’re being condescending and facetious
Gs from sea to shining sea
You may bump this in your Caprices! Bow!

Yeah, I once had a friend named Charlie
And Charlie was always late to school (School)
He had a black eye one day
But he wouldn’t say just what happened to him (To)
Charlie got mad in class one day
And stood up with a .22 pistol
Told everybody that he couldn’t take it anymore
He was over being the victim
See, one bullet through the wall
And the history class was interrupted
Charlie fell down in a pool of blood in the class
That made it public
He said that the bullies in school
They drove him to be a suicidal
'Cause the mirrors didn’t reflect the criteria
Of an American Idol
Well, sometimes, I feel like I could run
Through the hallways with an AK, too
Not saying that I would
But it might feel good to off me a rapper or two, so
I loaded this pen with a hollow tip
And I followed Tip
To the hollow pits of my heart for shit
For you to role model with
Take a fifth of Jack and swallow it
Take a point shell and hollow it
Don’t be the one with the gun
Be the one with the rum, plus two models with
All the kids, listen up
Yelawolf don’t give a fuck about a club
I don’t wanna see you in school, tryna do what I do
Telling folks you gon’ pop the trunk
Make something of something
Or something from nothing, baby, wake up
Play Radioactive, let me see the reaction
See if I really give a fuck. Shady!
[Chorus: Lil Jon & (Yelawolf)]
Up in the club, don’t give a fuck
Up in the club, don’t give a fuck
Up in the club, don’t give a fuck
Up in the club, (Still don’t give a fuck!)

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Ugh, nine millimeter, ride with a heater, drive with a liter
I’m finna need a mic and a speaker
I’m finna be the prominent leader, confidence-eater
Tell competition, “Hasta la vista” (Oww!)
Dog, you putting my name in the middle of sucker shit
Is something like you getting raped by a stranger
'Cause you do not know who you fucking with (Yeah)
Crooked is a product of the S-L-A-U-G-H-T-E-R
You "haha"-funny, I had money when the DVD was a VCR
Niggas about to need CPR when they see the car, kill 'em, dead
Might pull over, fuck my chauffeur
'Cause I screw drivers—Phillips head
Them I’ma tell her to take me to Yela
Getting fucked up, I ain't feeling embarrassed
The feeling in the air is the 2.0's party
Like niggas and wiggas in Paris (Ahh!)

[Verse 4: Royce da 5'9"]
Nickel Nine, a rider, arriving at the drama
The driver firing the llama (Blaow!)
Got a bunch of fine bitches saying "Hi" to me now
'Cause a nigga said "Hi" to Rihanna (Hi!)
'Cause I look good, and I smell good
It’s a man’s world! (Woo...)
That's right, I’m the new James Brown
Drunk in an interview, fuck you finna do? (Nothing)
What I’m finna do is go to the strip club and order eight bricks
(What you doing?) I’m on my T.I.P. in A-T-L
Lookin for a lil' pretty young thing I can skate with
(Where we goin baby?)
Radioactive, Shady gon' make it go platinum, I couldn’t resist
To jump on that Slaughterhouse, Yelawolf
Lil Jon, "Hard White" remix!

Up in the club, don’t give a fuck

[Verse 5: Joell Ortiz]
Ugh! Lil Jon, let me get a lil' bit
I mean a minute, nothin’ crazy, it’s just that I’ma lyricist
And I’ve been sittin’ with this ridiculous venomous bite
And I’m ssssso ready to strike, a swing and a miss!
My dick swing in your miss
I got a missile, can’t call it, I might misdial
I’m in orbit, listening to Em’s last album
Guzzling gin: recovering alcoholic! (Ha!)
Everything looking all right
Welcome to the lyricist pub, who wanna bar fight?
In a bar so high cause you're dealing
With four dope motherfuckers and two hard whites
Deuces, period, crop circle
That's the family that matters, I’m not Urkel
But I’m smooth as Stefon when I move to snap on
Your eyeball, your shit’ll look purple (Ow!)
I’m a product of the PJ’s (Yeah!)
Still walk through that motherfucker in my PJs
Yeah, I’m in J.P. Morgan often but
Don’t think I could get chased out the PJs
So try me, punk, bet your body jump
When this shotty pumps, have your body slumped
Yelawolf let me rip this hard white, but (Ugh)
Please don't make me pop the trunk

[Verse 6: Joe Budden]
(Joe!) Roll that window down and start dumping
Pull up on whatever block that y'all on
Pills got a nigga walking round doing stupid shit
My definition of an oxymoron
That ain't never stop me from getting a bad one
I would tell niggas again but they heard the story
Furthermore, he got a couple I ain't bust
But there's no need to rush, they reserved it for me
See I’m all about fam, I don’t fuck with the rest
Goon’s that’ll squeeze 'til a couple is left
The squad, the facade, the sm-smoke and mirrors (Ugh, ugh)
Yellin' "Payback!", too broke to cover the debt
But I’m grown, adults, and whether that shit you say
You don’t reciprocate love or respect
You get plugged, and you gon' need doctors
To cover your holes as if they never loaded cassettes (Ayy!)
You probably didn’t hear me, standing on the couch
Get froggy, I'm breaking any bottle that's near me (Ugh)
So real I don’t need a hollow to prepare me
I’m the first one in the hood to catch a body using Siri
'Cause they be thinking that I seem crazy
Money-motivated, CREAM make me (Ugh)
Way out your league, go and dream, maybe
T.I., Team Shady

[Chorus: Lil Jon & (Yelawolf)]

Shadows
33 ContributorsShadows Lyrics[Hook: Joshua Hedley]
Memories of shadows haunt me
From the years when I was young
Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
There's a dark moon in the clouds
Misty fog in the swamp
Crickets chirpin' outside my window
The water it thumps in the bathroom sink down the hall
The lights flicker sometimes
The wind is howling, the dogs are growling way deep in the pines
A passin' car on the distant road, the only thing running
Nightmares in my sleep, the Sandman is coming
I see the ghost in the red cloak, the shadows are taking shape
The sound of a faint voice, lost and full of hate
Dry leaves crumble under the feet of the reaper
The limbs tap on my window, like the nails of a creature
Tales of goblins and fairies, a sacrifice on the prairie
A murderer that escaped, I'm disillusioned and weary
Lightning strikes on the hill, illuminating the cabin
The old man on the porch, evil and quietly laughing
Surrounded by demons
I'm an angel and they all want me
And to this day ...

Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become
[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Cigarette buds, and oil stains on the dying grass
The smell of the liquor, rising up from the broken glass
The crowds of black leather, the heat from the engines
Motorcycles and goons, bearded men and loud women
The cracklin' paint, the old shack with the swingin' light
The heroin needles passin', open in plain sight
Ozzy and Black Sabbath, the vinyl is skippin'
From the fight in the kitchen
Blood screamin' and kickin'
Smoke fills up the sky, gasoline on the trash heap
The mattress is burnin', I hear it poppin' and snapping
The rain soaked teddy bear, so heavy I can't lift it
The flask for the moonshine, I watch as they all sip it
The Halloween pumpkin candle, lit with a Pentagram
The Grandfather clock, with a broken minute hand
Surrounded by thieves, killers, thugs and some junkies
And to this day ...

[Hook: Joshua Hedley]
Memories of shadows haunt me
From the years when I was young
Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become
[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
I throw on my leather jacket, a collection of biker patches
One of them says savage, the other one Black Sabbath
Heavily tatted, barely any skin left
Whiskey bent after twelve, I'm always playing with death
Bullet shells in my yard, loaded gun on the shelf
Run the roads like a wolf, through the whole Bible Belt
Rattlesnake skin boots, toes up on the chopper
Fifty Harleys behind me, they all ready to slaughter
Drunk in front of my sons, drunk in front of my daughter
Spit, cuss, and I yell, it's like a one-sided quarter
'Cause I'm only heads up, no matter which way you flip it
No brake lights in my life, I'm either rich or evicted
Committed to my convictions, committed crimes with the quitters
Connected to my religion, the religion of sinners
Send a prayer to God, exhaling smoke off the meth pipe
Like puddles reflecting the ripples echo to next life
So here I am standing just like the ashes that fell from the fire
A seed that fell off that poisonous and forgotten flower
Became my own nightmare, but now I think it's charming
Especially when ...

Love Is Not Enough
40 ContributorsLove Is Not Enough Lyrics[Intro]
Man this fuckin' bitch
Took off, fuckin' with some college graduate
Punk-ass, Abercrombie wearin' motherfucker
Left me broken-hearted in the Chevy
It's all good though, know why
I got me bitch

[Verse 1]
Both of us was in the same class
In '02 in Antioch, Nash-Ville
And I wanted you so bad
That I forgot to mind my manners
Everybody wanted them panties
Every guy was hopin' to land it
We would flirt around and touch hands
Until we fucked around and took Xanax
And that's when you began to drive me bananas
I was in denial it's apparent
You began to lie to your parents
You should know that I can't live
Without you holdin' my name
Now my heart's in control of my brain
And I can't hold it in the lanes

[Hook]
Rollin' down 20, man
With this Jack in my cup
Feelin' down on my luck
And I'm doin' 120, man
Maybe I'm givin' up
Baby I'm givin' up
Baby what is happening?
Don't you believe in us?
Don't you believe in us?
She said I know you gave me everything
But love is not enough
Love is not enough
Love is not enough

Used to fuck so much, we missed school
You was there when I needed you
I was there when you needed me
We were un-separable
When I was broke, with no fuckin' food
You was tough enough to be cool
Skate holes all in my shoes
Dope-boys had me confused
I was in love with hip-hop
You was in love with that too
What made it come to a stop?
Had to have been the money issue, bitch
And I really miss the rain
I gave you all of my soul
And all I got left is a key-chain

[Hook]
Rollin' down 20, man
With this Jack in my cup
Feelin' down on my luck
And I'm doin' 120, man

Don't you believe in us?

Who the fuck are you fuckin' now, bet he's always takin' you out
College-educated and proud
Me, well I'm just a drop-out
Can't really blame you for buggin'
Ain't I the dirt on your rug
And just the place to wipe your shoes
And give me all your thrown away lovin'
Back to my buzzin' and druggin'
Back to my gutter with nothin'
Back to the "What, all the sudden?"
Cracks in the covenant, trust in me
You ain't gotta worry 'bout sharing this success with Wayne
Now it's just petty change but I still feel the pain

I can't seem to get you off my mind
Turn on the station, but I'm still facing you and
Everybody seems to lost their mind
It's hard to handle, so I change the channel on the
Radio... 'Cause internet killed the radio star
Radio... And YouTube killed the video star
Hit the radio, we can make a- make a video, now I'm a star
Hit the radio, we can make a- make a video, now I'm a star

[Verse 1]
Picture me rollin' Pac, it's funny how time has changed
Everybody's a critic now, it's all a debate on the internet wave
It used to be you and Biggie, Chili Pepper's Give It Away
Now we got ten year-olds sittin' back in a chair like "those were the days"
And though it seems so amazin' to me that the labels lost the touch
And I'm in the AM, flippin' through the A.M. like I lost my crutch
Limpin' 'cause I can't even walk straight if I can't turn it up
Sippin', I need some Gin and Juice, Snoop Dogg, I brought my cup
What's up, ah ha, okay, shut up
'Cause I think we had about enough of radios and lust with the love bugs
Well let me give you a big hug a bag of mushrooms, here, take some drugs
And play some group home or something
Shit, the Goodie Mobs Soul Food is bumpin', rewind

And you'll never hear triple six 'cause we live in the midst of the Bible Belt

Let em' rhyme, let em' hustle, let em grind
Let em' roam with the truth sometimes
Sometimes, the truth is dark but the darkness sparks the truest art
And you didn't even know you had a window till a tornado blew it apart
If Eric Clapton could sing about cocaine, then there's no harm
Then I can write about guns, I can rap about girls
I can sing about money and cars
Not that my money is large
Let's talk about broke is a joke
Let's talk about gettin' evicted
Everything you owned thrown out on the road
And maybe that there goes gold
Shit maybe it’s platinum sold
But they don't want to see the green leaves from the pirates' gold

Come on inside, if you're sick of the rain
Turn the radio off and don't complain
It's all a replay, it's all the same
Got one drag, on a runaway train
On a one way street, better pick your lane
Yeah, but you could let me pick your brain
And we could be that Rolling Stone
Mix 'em up with Janis Joplin
And let 'em harmonize like Bone
Or we could just leave it alone
And let it take on a life of its own
Or we could be that World Class Wreckin' Cru
And tell 'em to turn the lights back on

Two hit, two crippled
Two fucks, not too given
I'm goin’ to get 'em
Or goin' to prison, woah

[Verse 1]
Dangerous mind of a 22-year-old me, damn what a shame
But I didn’t know the pizza man, I'm just lookin' for the cheese and the bread for the culinary gang
Culinary gang, fuck it and I let the mullet hang
I ain't got the budget to go cut it anyway
Wait, I forgot, I'm paid
Feels like yesterday when I hid in the shade
Now I live in a crib on the hill but I still wake up like I never met Sway
Never opened up for Wu-Tang, like Charlemagne Tha God, got nobody left to hate, perfect
Dirty white boys like me from the South got plenty shit to talk about
Like a front porch with a couch
What, you ain't never heard of Mountain Dew Mouth?
In West Virginia, they put that shit in baby bottles
Way I see it is, fuck it if you want a retard kid, it's made to swallow
So put a bigger hole in a rubber nipple, 'cause his little brother is soon to follow
Be a toothless coal miner just like daddy was and die young way back in the hollow
I’m on some other shit, I’m on a mothership
Keep up with me, no, hoe don't, psych, bitch get a grip
Been around this club
With bros and played all my hits
Jump from stages to mosh pits and swung my fists
Opened up a show for Wiz Khalifa
And his fans all yelled at me, damn
Soon as I get back to ’Bama
I'ma tell my mama y'all heckled me (Perfect)
Motherfuckers ain't poppin’ no trunks tonight, huh
No, good to go, well fuck me
I'm comin' back to San Diego with Danny Trejo with no machete
Food for thought, words must be edible
I gotta tapeworm, never full, ha
Mixtape worm, never coiled
Tangled and stuck, loose and pulled
Like a Reader's Digestive system
Twisted with a list of mystic raps I unfoil
Like a brisket hot, chopped, or liquid boiled

Well, mama sent me down to the MAPCO
BC Powders and a bag of tobacco
Said her boss was an asshole
She been on the line just breakin' her back, though
I need a rope with a lasso
To catch a pot of gold and get past the hassle
To get my mama a castle
A Pink Cadillac with the matching tassels
Take my daddy off of that backhoe
Send him down to Florida to fish on a bass boat
And a truck to match, so
He can roll around town pullin' his bass boat
Lord, I'm a dreamer, I can't pay her
She'll be on the line 'til daddy can come save her
Could've been rich, a star, a ballplayer
But I got no cares, Opie Taylor

Well, a quarter pound of pot in a shoe box
Got five grand stuffed in a tube sock
Ain't got no fucking credit to use, I
Paid cash for my car at the used lot
Small town, trapped in a sinkhole
Still keepin' it cool in the pistol
Me and dope's like green to a pickle
Yeah folk, like a haystack to a sickle
Never brought back home a report card
Spent more time in court, dog
But in this little town, it's a short fall
Still servin' out, jump off the porch, dawg

Country folks don’t talk much
They just get to work sawdust
Chainsaw, axe, knife, cut firewood, burn, logs, heat
Sleepin’ bag by the bricks: call me the fly, I’m on some shit
Drum this out with two sticks
Supa hot’s too cool for new kicks
Zoom, raps make mummies jealous from a tomb
Knock twice if you feel it
Born to rip, I should’ve been
Perforated by the rings like a Mead notebook
Squares want an artery blocked when I’m around
Circulated, nerds are in, Urkel made it
I’ll slap Urkel, take his lunch money
Punks they run from me, drunk and upset
But I don’t run clumsy, punch a perp’
A one, two, three: I’m at the Chelsea Hotel
Like Sid & Nancy with the knife, and two grams of candy
Give me the dizzies, fee, fee, fuck me
Please oh please don’t leave
Just give me the keys and crank that beat
‘Cause I might double up and straight dry heave
But believe, oh believe I’m cold, I’mma freeze this beat

On that ass, bitch
And I be bumpin’ this funky-ass shit to ride to
Yeah, and I be bumpin’ this funky-ass shit to ride to

[Verse 2]
So what’s new?
Been on that shit, where’s the atlas?
Thumbtack it, South Cackalack it, Alabama has it, go
Relax in a 1985 box train, perhaps I’m playin’ Relapse
Boss, Eminem saw the gem in him
Oh, me? Yeah, who thought?
Just toss the white trash out the window
Now I’m in a ditch like broken pencils
Empty bottles and stolen rentals
This one is for all my kinfolk
Yeah, bring ‘em in, though
Out the rain, what’s a friend for?
Word, oh for sure, yours truly, at the door
Had to add a syllable to that word
Country, but, oh, of course
Bitches go berserk for certainly, no need to be coerced
Odd economy, don’t need no nine-nine-nine-nine-nine and I know
Just the na, na, na, na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye, and hey, let’s roll
These hoes are no good, pills are okay
I just wanna get high, fuck what you say
Wild, the pen-play kind of like a samurai sword
With a Bic bitch, bow to sensei
Motherfuckin’ bitch, it’s pay your rent day
Do I not look like my name was MJ
One glove and a fuckin’ pair of penny loafers
And I moonwalk on the tempo like Billy Jean is not my friend, no
[Chorus]
On that ass, ho
Bumpin’ this funky-ass shit to ride to
Yeah, yeah bumpin’ this funky-ass shit to ride to
On that ass, bitch
Bumpin’ this funky-ass shit to ride to
On that ass, ho

Radioactive Introduction
42 ContributorsRadioactive Introduction Lyrics[Robot]
The United States Army has issued a warning
Three nuclear bombs have been launched from North Korea
And will hit Orlando, Florida; Las Vegas, Nevada;
And New York City, New York
This will expire at 5 o'clock AM Eastern Standard Time
Please get to an underground shelter or a fallout shelter immediately
Once again, three nuclear bombs have been launched from North Korea
And will hit Orlando, Florida; Las Vegas, Nevada;
And New York City, New York
This warning will expire at 5 o'clock AM Eastern Standard Time

[Yelawolf]
I am...
I am the American eagle, eyes of a sparrow
Right hand branch, left hand arrow
Chasin' a dollar, in an Impala
White trash heart throb, Mellow Yellow
Drinkin' hard liquor, brauds get on my level
I'm hotter than the bottom side of a whistlin' kettle
They threw a mountain at me, I got hit with a pebble
They sent me to hell, and I shit on the Devil
Try to bury my Chevy box but I won't buckle
And that's a deep hole bitch, bring a long shovel
Long gone, I'm grown up, and I'm gone cut you
But a grown lady, but if you want a blade, then holmes fuck you
Fuck you till you can't take a shit
Yeah I'm a fuck everybody, tsunami, better anchor the ship
Aim for the ankles and wrist, I came for the dangerous shit
I claimed to be named for the hits, the game is a chain that I grip
Slang from the pain of a trip it took to see Wayne in the whip
I became what I came to get the chains for the change I give
A quarter for your thought, appreciate the contribution
Slumerican, I'd depreciate the Constitution
Alleviate the crew when, I leave a page in ruins
To each his own, I guess I own each and every room in
The house I built is full of hopes, no ifs
So I stand with a giant like a king, no stilts
If I'm Generation X, I'm sellin' X, no pills
Dopeman choppin' up lines you don't sniff
Read 'em, I'm bringin' back booklets and hookless, lyrics
So you can be certain just in case you didn't hear it
But what he says, come again? what is that?
Come to Earth, touchdown, I might be your runnin' back
Because you hollered, run it back
Stay cool enough to wear toboggans as a Summer hat
Steady on the drum I rap, hope there's no one under that
Rock that I roll, mosh pit flow
Girls on your shoulders get topless at the shows
Fuck your mop and glow, can't mop a dirt road, it only makes mud
Raised around a deer, I know how to chase bucks
Babysitter, 16, taught me how to make fuck
At 7, I've been raisin' hell, so I can make it to Heaven
Pick up a 2 liter but I only need the plastic
Know how to make bombs with aluminum and acid
Butterfly Effect of a hurricane's magic, tornado path in
The rear view mirror of my '87 Classic
I'm talkin' about Gadsden, look mama no hands, I'm RadioactiveYou might also like6Embed

Growin’ Up in the Gutter
39 ContributorsGrowin’ Up in the Gutter Lyrics[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Once upon a time in an apartment home
Lived a little girl with a heart of stone
Cause part of her heart was partly gone
Rarely seen and hardly known
Treated like a mat in a boxing ring
Blood drop stains on the twin box springs
Daddy came to visit it’s not a dream
She thought to herself "what is happening?"
Above her head is a crucifix
But Lucifer loosens up his wrist
Lays her down with an open fist
And all that was left was hopelessness
Little girl, where’s your loving mother?
Under the covers, under the covers
Little girl, what have you discovered?
She stuttered…

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
Growin’ up in the gutter
No more, fairy tales, and songs
No place like hell, no place like home
Growin’ up in the gutter
Black and white, in a frame
There we are, safe and sound
Stray guns, no aim, yea!
Growin’ up in the gutter!

(And you ain’t gotta be from the projects to deal with this nonsense)
'Cause even in suburbia somebody will murder ya
Over nothin', leave your body slumpin' in the parkin' lot of your complex
Violence is a hard pill to swallow and digest
My town is full of drug dealers, most of 'em get shot in the process
Hustlin' and stackin' up profits
They robbin' mutherfuckas like they havin' a contest
Shit, he took a bitch to his apartment to brag
A week later he tied up on the carpet and gagged
'Cause he showed her all the pills he had for sale for the low
She told her cousin then her cousin grabbed a Glock and a mag
Kicked-in his door, laid him down, then he shot him and dashed
Ran off with all that he had, used to be ballin' now he got a colostomy bag
What you know about that?
Middle-class white bitch slangin' her body for crack
Mexican drug cartels, you hear the buckshot shells
And then the blood clot fails, there ain't no healin' the wounds
Biggest meth bust on the East Coast, right here in Duluth
My lyrics are proof of growin' up in the gutter

[Interlude: Yelawolf]
You think you can define how hard you got it?!
By what neighborhood you live in muthafucker
Wake up in the gutter!
[Chorus: Yelawolf]
Growin’ up in the gutter
No more, fairy tales, and songs
No place like hell, no place like home
Growin’ up in the gutter
Black and white, in a frame
There we are, safe and sound
Stray guns, no aim, yea!
Growin’ up in the gutter!

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Slumerican indeed, I am
Drug through the mud like a weed, what I am
Was child who was beat, I am
Leather belts that made me, I am
Home alone again at 8, I am
Somebody’s life to rate, I am
Given to the beast by fate, I am
The one who did escape, I am
A voice for the cold in the dark, I am
The one who sold his heart, I am
From a family torn apart, I am
A target for your dart, I am
Sick again from the whips, I am
Head to the gun and click, I am
A soul that don’t run from shit, I am
Exposed to the g.o.a.t.s. of sin, I am
Met a ghost and he said, I am
In the basement in red, I am
Dead cause the Ouija board said, I-A-M
[Chorus: Yelawolf]
Growin’ up in the gutter
No more, fairy tales, and songs
No place like hell, no place like home
Growin’ up in the gutter
Black and white, in a frame
There we are, safe and sound
Stray guns, no aim, yea!

Sky’s the Limit

They said the sky is the limit
Well I guess it all depends on you
And your views
In this American dream
Don't tell me that the sky is the limit
Cause it ain't about what you can do
It's a who knows who
In this American dream

[Verse 1]
Okay you got criminals everywhere, right?
Criminals smugglin' dope across borders to feed America's high appetite
Kis, pounds, ounces, grams, whatever the weight of substance is gettin' sold
Cause drugs got a price
Home hydroponics, LSD chemist
Spoon cookin' heroine, junkies fill up methadone clinics
Get caught for crack and catch a long sentence
You ask me how I feel about that, maybe you got the wrong witness
I heard Jay Z's cool with Obama
Obama must be cool with me then I guess if I'm packin' up this Honda
I highly doubt it but fuck it, it's worth a shout out
At least that's what I tell the judge before I gracefully bowed out
Meanwhile, I'm gettin' taken to the county for a seed
There's a news flash on the holdin' cell TV
Boston bombed by a terrorist at a marathon
8 year old killed and the killer's still free
Shit is hard to believe

I ain't no politically savvy citizen
I'm just an average man who writes poetry about witnessin' fuckery
And these police who always fuck with me
Done my fair shire of dirt, my boy, trust in me
But I picked music over hustlin', and I made it out luckily
Could've been on corners droppin' quarters from a bucket seat
My cousins preach about the lord but all I see is crime
If the Vatican has got the book then what the fuck is mine?
Just a line with a hook
You might as well be a rapper cause you signed and get booked
All the same to a suit
Black or white, you still a crook
If you ain't a Justin Leave It to Beaver with that look
Then just drop the egg in the skillet, let it cook
Who y'all bein' took
No I'm not a crook, son but this one ain't shook
But I'm rollin' Mobb Deep, my dreams on a Harley Davidson
Pigs, I hardly wave at them, yeah I said hardly
If I'm rude then pardon me but remember...

[Verse 3]
My grandparents retired from 9 to 5s
They paid for my hospital bills when mama was doin' lines
I wasn't raised up like the model American
But I love what it made me, life is all about where and whens
Whos and hows, that ultimately create my heritage
My great grandaddy Otis would sit down in his chair and then
Smoke a cigarette while he sipped on Muscadine moonshine
Homemade, and reminisce about the old days
He died of cancer when I was 5
I wasn't allowed to go see him in his casket cause I would've cried
I got so much value off life in such a short time
Memories stick to my heart and today they still apply
They used to share crops when they were poor
He worked his ass off at the mill and then he opened up a store
Both of my granddaddies fought a war
So I could say what I'm sayin' in this record for you and yours
For you and yours, the truth
[Hook]
They said the sky is the limit
Well I guess it all depends on you
And your views
In this American dream
Don't tell me that the sky is the limit
Cause it ain't about what you can do

[Verse 1]
I'll take your piss in that bottle, throw that bitch at your papa
Smoke flyin' off the chopper and it's chokin' your mama
She can't breathe with this funk, what I conceive in the trunk
They disbelieve in the slum, bitch, best believe I'm the one
I got that bump in the back with the box of bodies
Creek Water 'til I'm walkin' wobbly
I'm a businessman, I don't keep it political
Fuck the world and I'm not sorry
The priest was thinkin' I'm Illuminati
'Cause Eminem is a close kin
He might as well be 'cause I give him hell
For that white bread, put the toast in
Not simply a rapper (Uh)
But I snap like a crispy cracker
When I peel the pages out the book and hook it
That's a life story, no empty chapters
Pull up on 'em in the '59, shinin' like a trailer park king
Let the boots take a walk

Money pilin' up, I ain't got shit to do
We hit the bar and settled up a twenty dollar tab
I left her bein' drunk and walkin' out the back without a ride
Or even bein' smart enough to get an Uber
Go to Hooters, takin' double shooters
Throw a lot of hooters, hit the alleyway
And paddle my way over to the studio, I'm travelin', a mover
Head rattlin', I'm at church with a newer God
On another level, bitch, better grab a ruler
Quarterback of anything Slum and I'm throwin' bullets
Could've been a stylist, you admire this mullet
Wanna catch a vibe, then take a violent bullet
Walk a country mile and take a ride in my 'Cuda
For the 808s up under the bench of the Chevy
For the Bettys gettin' ready
Throwin' the confetti, hittin' the powder heavy, uh
Catfish deep gettin' heady, alien shit for my ship, SETI
And it's a walk in the park
When I'm talkin' the talk, like walkin' a dog
No leash for the beast, no caution at all
Be alert if the dog starts barkin' at y'all
'Cause I'm a marvelous shit starter
A public hit, causin' the market to flip harder
But fuck it if I can roll, these suckers just pickpocket
The creative profit and go remake it to make a dollar

Hustle

Rolling with the top down, on peanut butter guts
Trolling, I'm about to clown
Let me go and turn the bass up (Turn it up)
Holding that Glock nine, in case a hater run up
Golden, I'm the shit now, so your bitch on my nuts
I got my car smoking, but it ain't the motor
It's just me and that dodo
These bops strolling, I stop and poke 'em
But I'm trying to get that dough, ho
Ridin' dirty, ain't no hobo
It's just me strapped up like a GoPro
And I'm one deep; Han Solo
Laws trying to capture me like a photo, hustle
All I need is two cups of drank
With the system crank in the fifth of faint
See me pulling pranks in my candy paint
Pull broads around me in crowds
Vogue tires when I hit the breaks
My hustle skills you can't debate
Money don't wait, I'll be stacking up bank
Till I'm dead and up in them clouds
Getting to the cake, man, fuck your faith
Riding outta state with a Texas plate
Speakers in the back beating like an ape
4 15"s Rockford Fosgate
Crawl like a snake, boys gonna hate
But it's money to make, don't fall for the bait
Save the bullshit, I ain't gotta cape
All I got till I'm in the grave
Is a whole lot of hustle, hustle

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Yeah, couldn't tell me not to believe in the people
That I was put in-front of and told that I had an opportunity
To become a part of a situation that put me in a position
To maybe some day break out of a small town, I guess
I fell for the okey-doke
I suppose, I couldn't turn around in the hokey-poke game
To see lames and other folks who thought a joke was being played on me
Oh well, the story goes again, here we go again
I'll again frown while the motherfuckers grin
I can hear the sound of the gate closing in
And I can feel the breeze of the hate blowing in
Cause they all wanna go sight-seeing
Hop in the Chevy and ride for a little while
Then they kinda wanna drive
Even make a turn, off a road you ain't familiar with
And offer to pay for the gas for a little bit, then
Before you know it, you got a best friend
But when he started off, he was just hitch-hiking
Should have heard real when they said "Wolf for real
If ya chill, then you'll find another one just like him"
But it's hard as a motherfucker to say No
When you're a rookie talking to a veteran playing pro
And everything that he's saying
He's saying to pay him close attention
So you put your hand low
Palms out, opened, hoping
And you can't even see that engine smokin'
Plus all the money that he gave, you owe him
Rear view mirrors all of them broken
Black boys, white boys, just a token
For the slot-machine, and the gambling notion
Scamming and scoping, the animal inside
The cannibal chose him, me
I fell for another man's hustle

Pack it up and send it all away 9 to 5

Peace to the gods
Way to hit the breaks home boy
You about to fall asleep in the car
Run a red light on me motherfucker

Man, I could make a deacon dirty when I speak
I’m murdering, I make a mean-mug and cuss
When I lean in the Cut - lass
It's this "30 ought 6" swingin' outta that window
Tires in the mud (Uh-huh!)
Got the soul of an old man, I can feel the love
So call me daddy, lay my balls on the Caddy
‘Cause I drive 'em nuts
Don’t follow and @ me if you ain't followin' rappin'
‘Cause I’m about grinding plus
These songs that I write got life like a sycamore tree
Let it grow tall, get thicker, more leaves
Til the boys on the blogs are losing hair
Well let 'em go bald, just give 'em more weave
Yela’s in the kitchen potpourri
Did I forget to mention I’m an emcee?
Did I have to prove it on BET
In a cypher twice, well it just might be

So, Radioactive had a couple of radio-attempts
But, I don’t wanna be radio-active anymore now
Than I wanna jump off a cliff
This I promise
Catfish Billy, you can put Trunk Muzik in a picture frame!
You ain’t gotta tell me that I made a mistake, and some of that shit was lame
But all I wanna do is say "fuck that shit" and please accept my change
I was only tryna people-please
So people, please know my name
Now back to the metaphors
It’s better for me to settle scores instead of more self-loathin'
I put tags on toes
And like I’m in the morgue and I’m giving no pedicure
Set a store on the corner sellin' melanol
Set sail on a pale horse with a sword
Yea me behold, in a white Caprice classic, pedal to the floor
Flying by the seat of my pants
‘Cause I need what I need
I believe that I can go achieve what I came to achieve
And I leave you and you with the new CD in your hands
Put it in, put it in, let the 808 fill that space
Any kind of high never feels this great
You can feel the taste, you can see that smell
You can touch the moon when you hear that bass
Thank God that I got this gift, damn right and I won’t shut up
Let the gray hair fall down like an OG, damn right and I won’t cut em

Say what you want to about this white boy
But I know the truth and rap’s in his soul3Embed

Sticks and stones, and bricks and bones
Lift to me dome, and all of my poems
Spittin' my wishes, wishin' me cold
But the cold can't defeat me, I can't be frozen
Preachin' my own shit, praying for hand-me-downs
You ain’t original enough, look what is standing out
You just stand around, waiting for God because their careers ain't panning out
Pulling your panties out (Oh!)
Wind 'em up, and waddlin' up like a duck for the season hand-me-outs
Hopin' to fan me out
Yea, you was hoping to fan me out
But the harder they fan, the bigger the flame gets
Call me a motherfucker, speaking my language
Bang this, bang this over your head
Til you fall back asleep homie, easy and painless
While I stand over your monument like a crane-lift
With a thousand gallons on the palet to play with
But even though I give you many colors to paint with
You at the copy-machine with my fucking painting
So go ahead and make your changes
I'll be back in the booth with my fucking flame lit!

Breathe in, breathe out
Just gotta realize

[Verse 2]
Cause all my life I've been a firestarter
I don't know what it is about my soul that's got me hot and bothered
Somebody find me water, somebody find me water
Cause I'm hotter than a preacher's daughter
Hotter than dry leaves in August
Yeah, I'm a firestarter!

Rap til I'm golfin', ten toes down motherfucker I'm all in
Y'all play too much, get to pausin'
Remind yourself Yelawolf is a auction
Going once, going twice, 25-35-50-55, balling! (Oh!)
Better take it with pride partner
Trunk Muzik is a piece of gold
Uh, yeah! Take it from the trunk and throw it in the deck
Bitch you got head, now that'll give Denzel a whiteboy's redneck
With all due respect
So run it back till you go dyslexic (Oh!)
Long wings like Texas
In your girls bathroom like Nexus
Back of the line
You already know who next is

Alright DJ come take the wheel
And I'll set this fucker off
Pull Catfish up out by the gills
That's how I would do your jaw
You don't want no problem here
Not the line you want to cross
Take the rapper over here
And I'll feed him to the dogs
Just because, just be cau-tious
Look at you like, "Nah cuz..."
Mad cause we got bitches licking lips and throwing bras up
Got no time to talk, cuz
When I snap, it's all good
If I cut you down then best believe I'm throwing sawdust
Aw shucks
Aw fuck, I'm just playing, shut up
Fair warning not too subtle
I lay dormant but ooh brother
Got holy water like two puddles
And landslide the vampires are vandalized
With cans of Krylon damage and design
Sanitize the inner prize
The plan is amplified
Fans are f'n tired
By the need, provided me
Allowing me to open the
Show is over, no promoter
Locally and overseas
Would tell you different, I'm a timebomb
Tick, tick, tick, tick, I'm an icon
Slumerican tossed the barbarian off the bar area
Plus the dyed hair blonde--
Bitch over there, got her hips in the air
And her tits I'm aware, I'ma dip in a pair, I'ma lick on the set
That I'ma smash it, attack it, in the back till she's pissing the bed
Fist full of hair at your crib and a lawn chair, you got a visitor there
Face shot to the clear, she dropped on the legs, yeah, and I let her kiss on the head
Hold my beer, don't hold my breath
Hold my weight, showing flex
I'm so hard, diamonds envy 'round me
Look, I'm so cool, I got my own climate
Mountainous terrain to climb no
You fuckin' with the hustle, need a rope
You want the vintage turquoise, Navajo
I stained that shit from stage at every show
Brad Spit, Matthew Mcconaublaze
Hollywood meets Elvis Messy
Pull up in a beat-up Honda that I stole to drunk drive cause I like Chevy's
Oh, here I go, no red carpet and no rope
Put me down there with my folk and let the Slum come strike a pose
I write my flows like a fighter
These are punches being thrown
To your nose, duck and jab
Leaving blood patterns on your clothes
I might be white Muhammed Ali
As-salamu alaykum, here for the feast
But I couldn't be a Muslim, that could never be
Cause I'm still pissin' in a barrel full of beez
Like a chair for a bear, I'ma need a bigger seat
To sit cross-legged, I swear I'm a Chief
Here y'all hoes staring at me
Better mourn the cow, bury the beef
I clip your wings like there's no air beneath a parakeet
Give you some rings around your eyes like I said marry me
Get to the bottom of it like Titanic, very deep
Make you a model puppet, like Jim Henson every week
Sesame Street, yes sir Big Bird
Leave 'em black and yellow like I live in Pittsburgh
Shit turds, with quick words, throw bricks of wit, this pick is yours
All my fans, they pump the fist, get lit, and flip the bird
All my jams, they bump and kick and I just stick the words
Like a tube of super glue does for model aeroplanes
If the music chooses you, add the wheels and glue the wings
Then the paint, then the strings, then from the ceiling it will hang
Collect them all, don't let 'em fall
Until the critics come and frame
You working pictures then you switch up and you work on model trains
Just to keep 'em in suspicion like a pro, that's why I changed
So to all the people who supported me throughout the game
Over the years, I hope you like watching me grow
Yeah, Michael Wayne, Michael Wayne

"I got a gun for a mouth
And a bullet with your name on it
So don't breathe when I talk
'cause you haven't been spoken to
But a trigger for a heart beating blood from an empty pocket"

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
I got blue wheels on a Harley blazin' a trail in the sunrays
Me and this lady, man, it's like church on a Sunday
I'm up from my rocker but rock and roll is my papa
Raised me up on this gasoline, Billy Jean was my mama
Broken hearts turned to spoken art, my blood is like lava
Hard as a rock when I'm cold, yet I can flow just like water
Grew up with people that's lethal, grew up with hustling daughters
Mothers and fathers alike, like it or not when you saw us
Live my life like a rebel, the devil's hot on my tracks
But I won't run from my demons, no, I embrace them in fact
So remember my spirit, when that Slumerican flag waves
From entrepreneurs to losers, users and runaways

[Hook]
"But a trigger for a heart beating blood from an empty pocket"
From entrepreneurs, losers to users and renegades
For factory workers, servers and hustlers all the same
Single mothers and others, nobodies, prisoners, no-names
For entrepreneurs, losers to users and runaways

Alcohol in my system to face the system of living
Marijuana rolled up, money on tables for women
For the strippers and divas
For those who didn't believe us
We went from single wide homes to homes with twenty foot ceilings
You may say you hate money, money isn't the issue with you
And all of your bullshit, you bullshit me and I miss you
Save your tears for your love, smile when love ain't around
I'm in the booth for my family, yes I'm holding you down
Keep pressing play every day
And if they hate, let them hate
Believe in you and that's all you can do, so fuck what they say
And remember my spirit when that Slumerican flag waves
From entrepreneurs, losers to users and renegades

Box Chevy (Part 2)
18 ContributorsBox Chevy (Part 2) Lyrics[Intro]
Hello Chevy
Chevy? There you go
Really? Well, listen to you
You wanna go for a ride?
Well let's go then

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time in a land of 'Bama
I met a little girl with a bent antenna
I was on the skateboard cruisin' by when I
Seen her in the yard with a sale sign in her
Didn't have a dollar to take her to dinner
All I really wanted was a chance to get her
Went to my piggy bank shoebox
Then skated right back and put my bid up
Look I know you want 3 for her, but I got 25 hundred in cash
Please nobody better deserves to sit upon a box Chevy like that
Not a stall, not a pause, not a chirp when I turned the key, man, everything worked
And I think I gotta new girlfriend
Black on black-white wall dessert

[Chorus]
My box Chevy that's my girlfriend
She's always ready, always ready to run
Box Chevy, that's my baby
Body so clean
I'm leanin' back in my box Chevy
That's my girlfriend
She's always ready, always ready to run
Box Chevy, that's my baby
Body so clean
I'm leanin' back in my box

Hello little baby, you're lookin' like a 10 with that there wax on
Funny how I never thought about another love like uhh
Cadillac on chrome
Or another way to ride home
At night I'm crazy, but little buddy you're such a lady
Gotta put rose petals on your dashboard
You never let me down, when we go to town
And you gotta beautiful sound
Out the back of the pipes, you breathe
Rum t-t-tum tum yessiree
And if I wanna get there in a hurry
You can run a corner with no swerving
I pull up and hop out of her lap quick
With the AC blowin' out them snow flurries
Cold in the woods, storms in the winter
I just let her run under the hood, let her get warm and then I enter
Can I re-introduce my buddy, try not to let her get ugly
But if I gotta hit a ditch and dip this bitch I'll leave a piggy muddy
It's

[Chorus]
My box Chevy that's my girlfriend
She's always ready, always ready to run
Box Chevy, that's my baby
Body so clean
I'm leanin' back in my box Chevy
That's my girlfriend
She's always ready, always ready to run
Box Chevy, that's my baby
Body so clean
I'm leanin' back in my box
[Verse 3]
This is is my box, this ain't no Maybach
Ballers say "Why Yeler?", Yeler says "Why not?"
Do it for time watch
My whip is timeless my address says classic
Address my box as your highness
Roll around the city with my girl
Come on everybody and meet my love
I know it wanna make you hurl
So I keep a brown paper bag in the glove
Spewing this, your new Buicks
You're new to rich, ruinin' whips
My bitch is better, whatever, baby
They hate greatness greatly my lady
They can't persuade me to put in suede seats
Take off my hubcaps, that just ain't me
Here we go again you and I ride, off into the sun of an Alabama sky
Rum t-t tumtum, say bye bye!

[Chorus]
My box Chevy that's my girlfriend
She's always ready, always ready to run
Box Chevy, that's my baby
Body so clean
I'm leanin' back in my Box Chevy
That's my girlfriend
She's always ready, always ready to run
Box Chevy, that's my baby
Body so clean
I'm leanin' back in my box2Embed

Uh, yeah

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
See I'm a walking, talking, barking, biting, fighting
Lightning in a bottle, Chevrolet golden model
Crystal glass full of Creek Water when I wobble
Past the keys to the vallet and hit the bundle
Ridin' vacant, draggin', scrapin', blowin' sparks over
Crossover laws, we jumpin', bumpin' Trunk Muzik
I lose it, I use it, I drink it, I hank it
I Waylon, I Willie, I'm dangerous
Aim for the ankles and this bitch's throat
Who in the fuck is this hick with the flows?
Catfish Billy got that pocket, homie
I'm a rocket, homie, I don't think slow
But I sink low in that bucket seat, low fashion is luxury
If I want it, fuck it, fuckin' yeah, I get it
I must be living on fucking street
Did you poke at that Robert Van Winkle?
Hanging down over his mink coat
I come alone from a known mobile home
I could roll you a cone with no wrinkles
Chevrolet hit with the sprinkles, got an El Camino after Cinco
Smurf Box Chevy like bingo, I got this bitch

[Verse 2: Rittz]
See I do all the reppin', North Atlanta legend
No piano lessons, I know how to push a key
Wasn't on the Freshmen cover
Guess that XXL wasn't thinking I was good enough to be
Rate me one to seven, I'm eleven
In my Chevy with your lady and her best friend
Make her g-string wetter than a headband
See me on the road and turn around and get a neck cramp
Look at your reflection, paint like I sparked the stars
Shinin' like a diamond, inside of my Audemar
She blow a dick like muah
Made her squirt all over the seat, now I gotta wash my car
It's like I dived on the slide at the water park
Her pussy was gushy, I dropped her off
On the steps like I had a job at UPS
Told her call me but every time we talk, I yawn
And when I and park my car, they come lookin'
And I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin' fuck a soccer mom
Or some dork bitch dressing up for Comic-Con
The Chevy bouncing like it had a hydraulic pump
The T-tops are gone, I speed off like a redneck screaming yeehaw
These laws probably seesaw, bring in police dogs
All they retrieve underneath the seat was a big pink double-D bra
That a big broad must've worn, I don't recall
But they tryna give me tickets like I won at Skee-Ball
In a black Monte Carlo, strapped like a narco
Riding through Atlanta bumpin' Tennessee Love
Reppin' CNT, but believe I'ma be Slum 'til I'm 6 feet deep in the ground
Up in my box Chevy speedin' off when I see the GCPD around and I be...

In my box Chevy runnin', you in a Cutlass
But my dope cut less, pass it like judgement
Wet paint and it's gutted, police say I'm up to something
Put the thirties on that bitch, tell 'em you gotta look up to something (Yeah)
This for the homies that keep money down in they sneaker box, that fast cash
In the trunk of my Box Chevy I keep me a speaker box like Outkast
People tryna get me for it, they staking out like Outback
But I got some killers that's in the front yard and I got some killers that's out back
There's something in my Box that'll put you in a box
Got your ho in my Box Chevy 'cause I'm fucking with her box
I beat the song of the year with a freestyle, who run it?
20 years in the gangster doing laps, and I got this bitch

Put the bass in your face, you can feel the tempo

You should wanna get a copy of the style
I'll lend your ass, the man so bad
From Alabama with a banjo, clap clap
Sling blades like a Rambo, fix that

Before I say goodbye I'd like to say good day
And I hope you say "good buy" when they ask was it worth for you to pay
For my music, for pressin' play
For all the stress that went into my songs
My love and hate
The most honest I could be with you to date
Is to say thank you Shady
For lettin' me be me with no holds bar'd
Thank you for the chance to enhance this old car
This old jar of moonshine is but two fine lines on a blank sheet but so far
These two lines point directly to my home on the mothership sonar
Valet UFOs, I go park
The dirty south needs a soap bar
In the mouth of these MCs but
But who am I to judge on what they love?
I guess they enjoy being broken co-stars
And I'm soakin' so hard
From the sweat that I could take my clothes off
I done fuckin' raked the whole yard
Should sit back and shake the gold off
But I'm already gone
I got a vision like Tela
Songs, in an envelope like letters
Lettuce, green, money, long
Wolf pack send the cow's home
And I'll keep makin' these albums
Yeah you might have heard a dial tone
But I was on the other line when I hung up the phone
I'll send a postcard when I leave
And think about you when I dream
And when I'm up under them high beams
I'll reflect that shining
So you can feel the heat of light
And life of father, son of Diane
Yeah I've done come a long way from Dixie Land
Take my hand

Fuck it, I'm happy for him, cause he caught a bad one
I popped outta that Easy Bake, landed in 'Bama, clean and safe
Dropped outta high school, reason, hey

Well here's your American pie

Bedwetter, trendsetter
Dead center of the attention and finna get better
Turn that pussy into wet weather
Is it hailing or it's meth weather?
Why do you inhale it? It make the sex better
Huffing a line, covered in hives
Walking on glass, breaking the ice
Money got me rolling like dice
Molly got me rolling like dice
Paid the price, I gave my life

Got a few things for the miss, I got no bling on the wristwatch
That denim vest, put that top rock of that vintage New York hip-hop
Where the funk at? Y'all lost that
Too much trap, not enough style
Too much go, not enough slow
Too much blow, not enough pot
Two months ago now it's old school
I'm like, fuck that shit, no, it's not
Look, you don't want it with the posse, pussy
Not me, try me, push me
Pull up on your fucking block, we mopping
Got you sloppy, gushy
Mafia, mafia, Slumerican is the mafia
And I am not being cocky but Slumerican is unstoppable
Give a fuck 'bout that Glock you tote, even my mama got pistols
You should be more afraid of Mama Wolf if you let that clip go
Gang, gang
Never snorted Columbian, bang, bang
But I snorted enough glue to knock a few screws loose
And the rails up off my train
That Ozzy Osbourne, why's he always going?
Lying ass rappers, not a rider, boy
I'm a rider for the music I perform
Got another tour, know what I did it for?
Family handing me bills
Enemies handing me grills
Can I be young and concealed?
Know I'm an animal seer
Only presented with thrills
So don't pretend to be real
Rappers are getting you killed
Punking you out of a deal
Suckered you out of the bill
Then owe the real thing
I'm the real thing
I will kill dreams
Freddy Krueger with the Ruger pumped into you
What's the music?

Sabrina
21 ContributorsSabrina Lyrics[Verse]
I woke up from a deep sleep
I must've had a nightmare
But I really cannot remember
My heart was beating up out of my chest and I was cold
I must've left the window cracked
Twenty-fifth of September and the winter's coming back
The house is unusually quiet and I'm wondering where Sabrina's at
By this time at eight o'clock
She would've been pullin' on my blanket
Saying daddy "I want some cereal"
Wondering where her mommy's at
My door is wide open
I can hear the breeze hit the curtains
Wind chime hangin' on the front porch singing
Sabrina must be asleep
I pull back the sheets
Get up and walk toward her room in the hall
Not a peep, not a sound, not at all
The anxiety of a father is settin' in
As I turn the corner to her room
Her Mickey Mouse blanket's on the floor
She isn't in the bed
I take a deep breath, put my hand on my head
Relax
It's a game of hide and seek
She's in the closet I know it
I open the door "Gotcha!"
She isn't there
The faint sound of the television from downstairs is playing some cartoons, she's on the couch of course
How did I oversleep?
"Baby girl, why didn't you come wake up daddy?"
Not a response
Fear turned to frustration
"Sabrina, answer me"
"'Brina, this isn't funny"
I ran to the couch, she's not there
I'm startin' to panic and I'm lookin' up everywhere
Guest rooms, bathrooms, cabinets
Under the tables, the attic
Wait a minute, oh God no
I know she wouldn't go outside
We live so far back in the woods
She wouldn't dare
It's too scary for a little girl just to go bye-bye
I'm trying to escape my mind's eye
But my imagination is runnin' wild
At this point I'm talkin' to God
"Please Lord, please I'm scared, help me find my child"
I run to the basement (Sabrina!)
Sweat beads on my hands
Pacin', thinkin', pacin', thinkin'
Turn my face in
The screen door to the backyard's ajar
I run to the swing set
Swing set? No
Sandbox? No
God dammit Sabrina where'd you go?
There's a trail to a pond that I take her to every day
Maybe she's down there
I run down the trail, it's about a hundred yards
We usually hang out on the pier
And as I get close in
Everything moves slow motion
Her little white shirt on the surface of the water
She was there – lifeless, floating (oh my God!)
The pain I can't explain, I couldn't say anything
I ran to the water
God, is this really my daughter?
I picked her up, she was heavy
I held her tight in my arms
I took her out of the pond
I laid her down in the grass
I couldn't breath, I gasped
Givin' her CPR, she wasn't respondin' to it
My phone in my pocket
My hands are shakin'
My vision's blurry
9-1-1 , send an ambulance in a hurry
But it was too late
No tellin' how long she wasn't breathing
Her skin was the color purple
Her lips were ice cold
She must have fell off the pier reachin' for her teddy bear
She tried to get out, she got wood under her nails
God, what did you do to us? What have you done?
I say my prayers at night, haven't I been a good son?
What did you do to my baby? She's mine, now give her back
You don't deserve her if you let her die like that!You might also like8Embed

And I rock, man, I'm a firestarter
Two handles of brown and a half a gallon of firewater
Tell the police they can keep knocking, we're doing illegal shit go to the window, bitch, keep watching
Chopping on that 808, ride by your house and make the window shake and the beat so hard, make the tempo break
And the next door neighbor wanna relocate - uh
You can hear me across the county line, bagging up dimes of rhymes, and I'm moving 20 P's at a time

I'm down on my knees again
A call for my repentance
The war has taken over me
I beg for the forgiveness
The bullets ricochet, uh
I hear 'em when I sleep now
The blood is on my hands Lord
From man, woman, and child (A soldier from my country)
I'm a soldier from my country (A slave unto my gun)
But a slave unto my gun (The screams to echo louder)
The screams to echo louder (Kill, kill)
God, what have I become? (Whoooa)
I pledge my allegiance
I left my family, a new born baby
To slay the enemy, the struggle for power
The lust, the vanity
I trusted America, she took my sanity

Eyes black and blue
She told them she would leave him
She said she was through
He took her from a small town
Showed her the big city life
He promised her the world
Then he made her his wife (He runs around town)
But he runs around town (Lies, lies)
He's a cheater and a beater (She's sleepin' with the enemy)
She's sleepin' with the enemy (No one believes her)
But no one believes her (Whoa)
A diamond ring, a glass of whiskey
The bottle of pain pills open and empty
She left a letter “To hell I send thee”
He brought home flowers, ashamed and guilty
Too late

I've been washed up, I've dragged
Through the mud like a thief

Take it up, take it down
Took a left, took a right

To explain to me why
Why it was me that was brought to the edge of the cliff
'Cause see this is not fair but why should you care?
The choices I've made are mine
But I swear that all cannot be the fault of just me
I've tried to maintain my wants and my needs
To work and not see the changes I've strived for
A better life for my family I would die for
Take away everything from me
And ask why more?
Tell me to make a decision in front of five doors
As I'm praying, I'm saying “Why Lord?”
Send me to a war without a sword
I'll fight and fight more
I'll travel a long road

Give you something to remember, then baby I’m
On my way
Fast women
Fast cars

Think you wanna turn around with that fat ass, Catfish Billy, you looking back at

I'm a million lightyears away from the dark
A thousand miles and running
Country boy can survive
I'm alive, a loaded gunnin'
Backseat full of crooks
Pen and paper, this one's for the books
Pack it, wrap it, seal it, send it
To the corner in a Travis Caddy
Everybody in this motherfucker jumpin', footprints on the wall
Gimme the losers, the ones who don't fit in
And with this shit we're gonna have a ball
Swing around the mosh pit, do-si-do
Catfish Billy and a Dobro
I'm Psycho White – oh, no
I'm a chili pepper in an Oldsmobile
Comin' out for the kill
I don't gamble
I don't deal with these whose whose in this mass appeal
I just wanna be behind a steering wheel of a semi-truck
Then get drunk and run amuck
With every single one of my misfits
Bitch, that's how we're showin' up
With them lowriders on the west side
Lift kits from the south
Jump in the passenger seat of my '69 and hit the bootleg house
I'm on my new shit, still ready and ruthless
A public nuisance
But I feel right at home

Still bumpin' Three 6 all day, Hank Williams all day
So promenade when the lights in the ballroom swing
And shake and then fall and break with that bottom bass
Make you wanna tear the club up and go tattoo your face
Country boys, gutter raised, what a blend, that's all it takes
Got a lock in the pocket, a rock in the sock
With a cop I'm a nervous wreck
I never could keep a job 'cause I rob and I take
And I leave you with nothing left
But mama tried
Mama tried to harvest early and the pot died
If she ever said I was a good boy, trust me, mama lied
Leave these haters with a cane to walk
Take these lames with a grain of salt
All I wanna do is take aim, assault, tell my story
Paint the wall from Alabama to Atlanta
From Atlanta I began to build a plan, a panoramic view
To center who my friends, the men around me was
The culture is that slum, and I'm not alone
I put a flag in Nashville, and I'm feelin' right at home

You're like the hardest thing I've ever seen
And I'm from the gutter so believe me, I've seen some hard things
You come from where the black flower grows
I wanted to cut you down and take you home, call me Axl Rose
I could see you in a 1976 Camaro
Me and you, sipping whisky, gettin' drunker than Jack Sparrow
Is Black Sabbath, how you get mellow huh
Well put your feet on my Harley Davidson pedals
And rock and roll girl

Ride or Die
16 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisRide or Die Lyrics[Verse 1]
We was thick as thieves growing up
Both of us raising hell
Chasing liquor with liquor
Racing and chasing tail
You got caught with a nickel bag and then went to jail
You sat it out for a week because your mama didn't have bail
I rode my bike to your house as soon as you got out
Remember laughing at the cops and then I took you straight to the spot
I moved away for some years to Atlanta, Georgia but stayed the same
My troublesome attitude got me locked in an ugly chain
We kept in touch every week and I noticed the change
You wanted to clean up and go to school some day do the family thing
And I was too wild to get it, admittedly so
But I supported your move no matter which way that you rolled
I guess you made a good choice, graduated with honors
Got a good job at the factory making that legal dollar
And as for me I got worse
I found myself in a curse
Dropped out of school for a dream
A dream I didn't rehearse
You hit me up cuz you knew when you saw me I was bad off
But I was too proud to ask for the help cuz I knew the cost
But you offered a place to stay
Until I could find my way
You helped me go find a gig
Clean up and get it straight
Never once did you tell me to stop rapping and give it up
As we sat talking on the bed of your lifted truck
You had it all and I had nothing
I'm just saying that meant something brother

It's been a while since I seen my friends, family and such
Six months a year on the road, I never get to visit that much
Even though it took me ten years to break a crack in this rock
Now that I started this movement, I got no plans to stop
Now you may see me in publications and radio placements
A new truck, a new Harley, and think I forgot how I made it
But ain't a day that goes by that I don't recall the struggle
Scared to death to go back to it, I constantly hustle
I thank you for my ambition
For the strength to condition
Anyone who helped me along the way and believed in my vision
It takes a village to raise a child
For me it took small towns
Everything that I learned from it
The ups and the downs
My Uncle Buddy, he gave me a thousand dollars to make a tape
Back in '02, when I could barely afford a plate
And he couldn't afford it either,  but he did it anyhow
And now he wears a thousand dollar smile, Uncle Bud
[Chorus]
If you ever need me around I'll be on the next train headed southbound
I'll never let you down, I can't let you down

Son of a Gun
32 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisSon of a Gun Lyrics[Verse 1]
I look in the mirror sometimes and think about how it all started
Small town Alabama, from city life we departed
Not a single light in the street, morning was scary and dark
To a little boy catching the bus to school, 5:30 sharp
I used to make up songs to keep my mind from wondering
What was in the woods waiting for me, my stomach still rumbling
From the cereal diet
Even though mama was trying to do the best that she could
Alcohol made her violent
Her boyfriend was a prick, probably 26
Barely looked my direction and really didn't do shit
My animosity grew along with my anger
And impatience , disaster in school
My teachers knew I was trouble waiting
And I did too, admittedly but I liked it
Maybe I had to accept I'd always be uninvited to church events, football and family oriented stuff
But I never thought I had it rough
I embraced it, honestly, 'cause I knew how different I was
It made me a rebel and rebels made me feel welcomed and loved
I never knew my daddy ,but they said that I was the same and what a shame, get your umbrella Wayne
Here comes the heavy rain

[Hook]
'Cause I'm the lighting to your storm
The bloodstain after a dogfight
The tornado to your alarm
Your hangover after a long night
I'm the snake outta your barn
That one mistake you ever did right
The gunpowder to your drum
I'm your son
The son of a gun
Son of a gun
Son of a gun

Up high and over the Mississippi to see the ocean, so here I go floatin', yeah
But I made it a habit though
19 and tattooed, hell raisin', the neighborhood was the place and I made it home with the vagrants
Quarter pound of that seeded Mexican trash slinging nickles
Making nothing and breaking even, just do it for tickles
Nashville's under icicles, the Methadone's penetratin'
Ecstasy-hungry, baited as an experimentation
No more chocolate-chip cookies, and porcelain jars
Morbid and dark are my role models, and old-school cars
Sickening and I'm lovin' it
I'm basking in half of it
Backstrokin' in sinnin' ways, a dagger to pastors
I never knew my daddy, but they said that I was the same and what a shame
Here come the cocaine in the heavy rain

[Hook]
'Cause I'm the lighting to your storm
The bloodstain after a dogfight
The tornado to your alarm
Your hangover after a long night
I'm the snake outta your barn
That one mistake you ever did right
The gunpowder to your drum
I'm your son
The son of a gun
Son of a gun
Son of a gun
Son of a gun
[Verse 3]
And you can tell that I still don't give a fuck
Still drinking whiskey I'm half-a-bottle already down
Slumerican-made man, Criminals all around
Seventy-thousand dollars a night isn't good luck
Livin' a story usin' my war as my shield
The truth, examined and recreated
The following's real:
Plenty of fatherless children fill up the pit in the buildin'
Usin' the mind for the feelin', it's just like poppin' a pill
And I'm takin' it in
Lost , and makin' a win
Thanks for the poems that you inspired, I'm rakin' it in
Never heard you say "give me five," so make it a ten
Keep the change cuz I'm ballin', look at the bastard of him
When I went to jail for the first time, I thought about you
Son of a bitch, I admit it, I guess the rumours are true
'Cause when I look in the mirror, I see from what I 'came
Trial by fire, pain, heavy rain

[Hook]
'Cause I'm the lighting to your storm
The bloodstain after a dogfight
The tornado to your alarm
Your hangover after a long night
I'm the snake outta your barn
That one mistake you ever did right

The son of a gun

Alright, let's get it

[Verse 1]
Silverado, black package
Dealership didn’t have time to tag it
I whipped that bitch out the parking lot
Like I was dead broke and I couldn't have it
Uh, swipe that piece of plastic
Rode around Nashville for three hours
Listenin' to beats, waitin’ for the magic
Swung by the crib, grabbed WLPWR
Hit the bar, of course the bar
Valet park my brand new car
Threw the keys and when you move it, please
Be careful and don't go too far
Took a second and soaked it in
Couldn't wipe off my big-ass grin
Look at Will, "Can you believe it, man?
Just wait 'til I get them twinny-twin-twins"
That's hard work (Uh)
I had to do a lot of yard work (Uh)
I had to pick up that white trash (Uh)
So I could bet on my artwork (Uh)
I had to cut my own path (Uh)
And do something that had never been done
Alabama ain't no cakewalk (Uh)
I showed the world how we popped that trunk
And it's one shot down, two shot down, three
And this old fuckboy keeps looking at me
He walks up to us then offers me a drink
I know that he wants to hang, he must think that I'm a tree
Wanna be rock and roll, he starts ramblin’ about who he knows
And where he’s been and how many records he's sold
With who and how and this and that
And I can’t pretend to like this douchebag
Even though he's got the boots, the hats, the leather, and the durag
The shit he told me he wrote for so-and-so is just so, so whack

Don't wanna be the supermodel for the clothes you wear

From over here, you just a bitch
From over here, a liar and thief, man
From over here, you make us sick

Don't come over here

[Verse 2]
Uh, black Schott jacket, black Harley, Lucchese
38 OG, creatively a new worn baby
From the G to the A dot D
Went from the Creek to a Love Story
Went from a single wide trailer to the boots alligator
And a highrise over the streets
Ran through the dirty South in cleats
Never lost touch, never got beat
Lot of rappers talk about who's doing what
Not a single one said shit about me, now that's respect
Can't buy that with a bat or a check, better check the beat
I mob with kings
Crown my head with a tattoo, Slum, make sure it reads
No more at sea
Fuck a message in a bottle, deliver my words like Desperado
Misfits under my umbrella
I hope these songs fulfill the sorrow
Take the bricks so you can build tomorrow
Like a freemason, claw and arrow
Free bird, a prophet's sparrow
Flying through hip-hop, rock, and metal
And while that clock is ticking
I won't let a soul living stop my vision
Give me that bucket and a mop to dip in
I'll shine that floor until it's popping prisms
'Til you see the colors of the rainbow dancing off my Box Chevy
Don't try to fill up my gas tank or my shoes, homie, you ain't ready
And if imitation is flattery, uh, I don't lack on the flattery
I just led gatherings up in my room with the magic
Go back to my cabin and charge up my battery
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna be the supermodel for the clothes you wear
Don't pull a seat up 'cause you see me in my folding chair
Congratulations, hope your mama's proud of what you've done
But she may be the only one 'cause

From over here, you just a bitch
From over here, a liar and thief, man
From over here, you make us sick
From over here, you fakin' to get rich
Don't come over here

Sun shinin' and the summer rain's comin' down
Comin' down
Lookin' back on good times
You and me, we was on the way
Small town with our names in the marquee now

Those were the good times

You'd carry me home, come on

If I never told you that I loved you
If I never said that to your face
Man, I'm sorry 'cause I really did and I really do
Ever since Gadsden, when we were kids
You was always my favorite
Told you if I ever got a record deal, I'd put you on, and I did
For that I'm proud, but, it was a hard road
Homie, what a tough act to follow
Eminem gave me a record deal
And I hit the road, it made you feel hollow
But you never showed it, you just smiled
All you ever said was, "Wolf, I'm proud"
"Wolf, go kill 'em," "Wolf, you've got this"
And you stayed at home and held mama down
She called you son, I called you brother
You even caught the heart of my grandmother
And when you got sick, she came to visit
On my behalf, and she kept you covered
Severed son of a preacher man
A quiet prophet with a raspy voice
Every time you picked up a microphone
The crowd stopped in awe 'cause they had no choice (Yeah)
Like yesterday (Yeah)
Like you never left (Yeah)
Slumerican on your gravestone (Yeah)
And the legacies beyond death
I broke in half, when I lost you
I guess I couldn't see then what I gained
My guardian angel in the streets
And a fightin' spirit to maintain, Jerrico

True to Yourself
20 ContributorsTrue to Yourself Lyrics[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Here we go to church on Sunday mornin'
Hangovers on 'em
Whiskey pourin' out of skin, it's like a poison
Beer-soaked boots from the barroom floor
It's perfume to a sinner, it's allurin'
Prophet for the slums, prayer for the dark
Barber straight razor blade, pocket watch
Rings on every finger, sacrificial skin
Story written in his blood, he's akin
To animals and criminals alike
Hood, project, trailer park, Backwoods
Sprinkles of the cocaine in his nails
Tank full of propane on the shelf
Fire's in the soul, the child is now a man
The enemies of good now become a friend
Watchin' God play his life violin
Happily, an instrumental in the wind
You will never fit, you're a misfit
You're a quiet voice no matter how loud you get
Despite the effort, you remain reckless
You remain helpless in the same outfit
As your father did before, you're a song
Better sing the praises of the written wrongs
Only time will kill your spirit if you let it fall
And that's why there's...

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
The rifle's in the corner, money on the table
Cellophane sacks, baby's in the cradle
Chevy's in the drive, cranked and ready for him
Lights a cigarette, ashes on the floor
And takes another toke, smoke fills the room
Sun sets behind the clouds, heavy gloom
Cops on the run, sirens in the distance
Wild small town, violent and resistant
In the street, they rage and fight
Any given night, it's just another reason for a killin'
Brave the cold and lock the door 'cause it's war
Storm filled with crime, only safe in buildings
Made of brick and mortar, brick of thick morals
Ain't got brick and mortar? Steel will support 'em
Steel with the trigger finger, take your life
Billy in the basement, wasted, makin' pipe
Bombs take it light, wrong take it real
Take a quarter pound of dope and make a deal
Take the front, son, run for the hills
Cowards under power, masonic seals
Cast a shadow over underprivileged minds
While they're chasin' money, hit some basic rhymes
If the world gives you pen and paper, draw the line
Because there's no time
[Chorus: Bones Owens]
There's no time at all

Hello kids I'm in
This bitch with hits, Big Cameron
Fuck around I leave your Momma with a candle lit
Speaking of candles lit, happy birthday me
Radioactive is a magnet for birthday treats
New house, fresh shoes
It's like all my opponents saw me and said let's lose
Good move
Is it me or the fate, let's choose
Cause I'm teaching the class, you mothafuckas slept through
So even the haters only instigating my students
But a couple of questions that I won't say yes to
Like Mr. Bobalina Mr. Bob Domalina
Can I sic em for ya Bob can I pick the chrome nina up
And pick em off for ya from afar with the beamer
Cause I seen I'm he’s a fault he’s a real cob-cleaner
I should let em loose but I refuse to be an abominator
You hate on me and you're probably an Obama hater
Laugh at you chronic players, sick with a sonic laser
And shoot you from Pluto with a soup bowl full of Now & Laters
Weakened and still seeking a shot cause I’m a power-fader
Shower these cowards without a doubt of my power
And take ya bitch without a shower
Til I’m sour ten hours later
She’ll still come back lying about the wonderful mouth I gave her
Ugh, everybody knows I’m a loose cannon with a wick
Bout the size a fucking toothpick
But I might go quick and assume the damage
But I gave this beat it’s like a treat for a chief example
That I got a way with tracks like a Chinese weave scandal
Back away from the bicycle
Tricycles fit you better
Pick another cypher, better yet pick up a rifle
And do yourself a favor kill yourself midget ho
And do it next to a river so nobody gotta dig a holeYou might also like2Embed

I never was the one in the classroom sitting with my hand up
When the teacher told us that we needed to report
Anything that was happening at home
Like if I saw pipes or things of that sort
Cocaine dime bags laying on my front porch
Never made me feel sick 'til I found out what it was
No telling how many adults went in through my home
Had a convo with me, unavailable
And maybe I've caught the vibe and maybe they're right
And maybe I'll follow them footsteps of my folks
But that's only a theory 'cause of the people near me
Love me enough to never let me do that dope
But the crew I roll with knew that road
We took a left turn and pursued that dough
I remember being scared of the goons in the room
Passing needles around, spooning, smoke
At the time my young mind was curious
Gullible and naive still
I run around the apartments, hidden in darkness
And sparked it with Chris, Robby, and Will
And I didn't like the feeling at first
The taste in my mouth or the smell on my clothes
But I kept showing up after school to be cool
I would do anything with the bros
And I told my mama lies over and over
What I was doing and where did I go?
Didn't hurt my feelings anymore
I didn't care about being an asshole
Unless my girlfriend found out
That my backpack had a fat packed out roll
But out the blue, she pulled a joint out her purse
That she stole from her folks, and that's all that she wrote
I quote

Let me hit one more time
Let me live, let me learn
Who am I for you to judge?
Who are you? It's just drugs
It's only weed, it's only pills
It's my dope, it's my buzz
One time, one try, then I say bye
I'm lying, I can't stop now, and why?
I tried this, I tried that, I came clean, my act
Took five yellow pills, passed out, came back

I made it home, I survived, I shouldn't be alive

Yeah, Tommy just got out of jail (Got out of jail? Got out of jail)
Two months he couldn't make bail (Couldn't make bail? Couldn't make bail)
Here we sit, whiskey bent, freestylin' over cricket chirps
He would spit, then I went, loaded gun, death we flirt
Leave it up to the Baptist church, me and him are scum of the Earth
Feelin' like two millionaires with a hundred dollar net worth
Topic of discussion is that they know nothin'
They didn't find the other twenty pounds hid in the oven
What happened to me and you? We used to go to Sunday School
And we worked Monday 'til Friday, and sometimes Sunday, too
Five-hundred dollar check and that's no disrespect
But I'm a talent, God damn it, you watch, I'm tellin' you
We had it all mapped out, hip-hop 'til we crashed out
I drank 'til I couldn't walk straight, on the front porch where we passed out
Nothin' but trouble, dealin' with troubles over our sorrow
And the clouds followed, we was just like

It's three o'clock in the morning, I got two packs of Parliament Lights and
A dime bag of that 'Bama brick, I just lay in the dark of the night on
The bed of my buddy's truck who got it from his papa back when
He died in a fire rescue and I never asked what happened
We listened to Charlie Daniels, Too $hort and Bob Seger
Sing along to "Night Moves", sippin' on gas station margaritas
Gotta get a good buzz out here, man, nothin' else to do but get high
Put bullet holes in beer cans and talk about how we gonna get by
Some say that dreaming's useless, full of pride and selfishness
Escapin' that mental prison's like climbin' the electric fence
And that's a risk, but a risk I'll take to better with
'Cause through Hell I've been, so success would be just self-defense
I took another swallow, can't share my dream with everybody
And besides, to the factory, I clock in tomorrow
And to my room, I wobble, but the vision I follow
A storm was brewin', we was just like

Go up in here and get a beer

Blues party
Uh, yeah. Woo woo! What up Gill?
What up mane?
Hey y'all

Hey, can you grab me a beer?

Ah, it look like DJ Klever, too, mane
Hey, Yela! Man, come up here and give these folks somethin'

This is Bones Owens to my right, right here
To my left DJ Klever

This is Trial By Fire

Uh
Back in 1979 it was a cold day in December
Mamma peeled the paint off the wall, screamin'
Babie's on the way
They rushed her to the hospital in that old Chevy truck
Running 90 miles an hour down them back roads
Blowing past the sheriff,  hid in the woods, smoke bellowing off the engine
Running hot, must have been a sign
They rushed her to the emergency room
And barely made it to the bed
A few minutes later I was screaming for my first breath
"A little devil," the doctor said
He's got that look in his eye, ya know?
Reminds me of mischief
Yeah this ones gonna be trouble I can tell it
And then the lights went
Then mamma said doctor something's burning, I can smell it

[Hook]
And it was trial by fire
I'm just under a plane singing to burn it down
You better watch your step
When I come around

[Verse 2]
Damn right, uh
You could hear lightning for miles around
And oak trees hitting the ground
The wind tore holes on that old Dixie flag on the capitol steps
Change is coming, my great grand mamma said
Quietly clutching her Bible, sitting in a rocking chair, smoking a cigarette
And the wood creaked beneath the porch and the old dog moaned and cried
As the sirens passing by
And Mr. Williams brought a mean batch of that moonshine to the wake
You know one comes and one goes as they say
And they laid a flower on the grave
Buried on December 29th for robbing a bank
And killed by the police, see you in the next life old friend
Little did he know, his old friend was back again
As the son of Sheila Diane
[Hook]
And it was trial by fire
I'm just under a plane singing to burn it down
You better watch your step
When I come around

[Verse 3]
You know how the story goes, c'mon
See me, I'm a curious soul
A stray bullet to some a chatter and whisper at night and the head of a following storm, a rebel at heart, a devilish grin
A leader of men, a preacher at ten
I was already in to spiritual sin
Back in the saddle again
12s in the back of the trunk, making it rattle again
Giving them nothing but punk
Living, the baby, the babie's got powers, the baby is haunted
Fuck a church, I'm a confession
Professional, public annointed
Came from the wrong side of the tracks
Bring the wrong crowds out the back
Keeping these gutter dogs raised
With these alley way cats
Seen what these others can't see
My poetry is a reflection of life looking up from the bottom
And climbing that fucking tree, but I brought a chainsaw
I come to build a house up out of it, chopping
Limbs off this culture, and putting soliders up inside of it
Nails, brick, mortar, board up the windows
For the tornado, I'm a fatal blow to these honorable foes
Bag up the hot potato
[Hook]
And it was trial by fire
I'm just under a plane singing to burn it down
You better watch your step
When I come around8Embed

Be The One

Ayy, what up, Ritchie?
I’m not sure if you’re aware or not but I’m Illuminati
We controlling the minds of all the youth
Shady, the evil empire
Yeah you got me pegged motherfucker
You got me, fuck y’all

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Man people really got me confused, what did I do?
Outside being a human being seeing my dreams through?
Never did shit to nobody but invite them out to my party
Get’em drunk and maybe even tell them a story or two
Some think I’m Illuminati ‘cuz I’m a light in the dark
Lookin’ for masonic symbols inside of my body art
That’s hilarious Marshall, what the fuck you do to these folks?
Crazy motherfuckers tryin’ to put me and you in the boat
With Royce da 5’9”, Crooked I, Budden and Joell
But I’m on this ship and I don’t give a shit, oh well
I see the storm, let the boat sail
And I’m on deck but the rain pourin’ off my raincoat tails
They see God in me ‘cuz I know Hell
They see the criminal inside of me probably ‘cuz I broke jail
But my soul is not on wholesale
And when I die, my people will be cryin’ the first
No? Well look

If I’m gonna be the one, then everybody comes to one
Then I guess the battle has begun, fuck it then, let’s have some fun
‘Cuz I promise I will never run, never run from what I’ve become
‘Cuz all that dumb shit that I’ve done, built me up to make me the one

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Jesus Christ sittin’ passenger with the .45
Turn the page, I got a new way to earn in pay
Stickin’ bitches up with a crucifix while Lucifer sits
With a Vice Magazine, burning every page
Well I guess it’s my turn to play
The wildcard of Shady’s clique and new world order’ll play
Talkin’ shit, yeah that’s sorta gay
But I ain’t homophobic; I punch a homo like I punch a man
No way, are you serious?
Claiming that I got hipsters brainwashed and they all coming to my show
But if you took a moment and took my dick out your mouth
You would see all the versatility on the front row
I convert, revert people to desert
People who miss being them people of Wolf, go home
And if you’re 'bout it enough, anybody doubtin’
They come to the Circle of Psychos and you be done
So look

[Hook]
[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
The one gathering people, some people think that I’m king
Some people think that I’m trash, some people shout and they scream
Don’t bother me, I’m a survivor, I’m alive and livin’ my dream
In a microwave society I’m a steady stream
Don’t need no validation from any cultural thieves
No magazines or blogs or anybody who don’t believe
If you’re behind the camera, than just point it at me
‘Cuz I’ll be making this movie and you’re just making a scene, check it
Missy Eliot gave me a shot and I love her for it
I wasn’t ready, I should have waited, but when you poor
And you got a two year old baby and one on the way
You be crazy to see opportunity at your door and ignore it
So you lookin’ back and callin’ me whack and ho for
When all I wanted to do was get my kids out that apartment
And that’s important
And I went from not having a home, to everything I owned up in storage
I made a sacrifice any daddy would make
‘Cuz I cannot stand and look when they look into daddy’s face
When the government picked away at every penny that I made
I had to borrow money to get my son a fuckin’ birthday cake
Yeah, I guess that’s a hard balance to weigh
Chase the rap game, or manage a subway
Well I suck at making a sandwich and rappin’ don’t get me paid
But if I stick to then I’ll get through with it someday
I’ll be the one, you can talk shit about me
I’ll be the one that you think is a part of some fucked up cult
I’ll be the one you can hate
But
[Hook]

[Outro: Yelawolf]
I ain’t mad motherfucker
It’s that new church, I be pastor
What’s up Wolf pack?
Let's get the summer started
Open up this rhyme book, give you some motherfucking quotables4Embed

See, all my life I've been friends with thugs
I never did judge cause my momma sold drugs
By the age of 5 I could hold a beer buzz
All I wanna do is show love to my boys
In the '88 Crown Vic, Rolling deep
Working so hard cause they can't, go to sleep
Got the same clothes that you rock, for three days
Hitting traps like a prophet, for petes sake
To the single mothers in the kitchen still cooking
No job open but shes out, still looking
If you don't, who the fuck will?
Not daddy, cause that mothafucka's not here
So stop askin' for the pennies and the hand-me-outs
You gotta look at life and get it without any doubts
Only a coward has to rob and pull a Semi out
Just to open the garage and pull a Hemi out, think big

[Hook - Yelawolf]
I crack the top and pour the fifth out
I wanna run around the whole wide world
Just me and my girl (Just me and my bitch)
I got a cup full of that Honey Brown
I wanna drank it with the whole wide world
Just me and my girl (Just me and my bitch)

Waking up before the sun rise, gettin' it

Put them eighteen wheels on the, highway
I'mma do it for the country bucks, fuckin' right
Got a problem with somebody then, fuckin' fight
Don't be a pussy, homie win some, lose some
Just make sure you make it to the house when it's done
Respect outlives any hollowtip
Pride will get you killed, better learn how to swallow it
To the rappers on the planet out dreaming
Learn how to write a record, homie stop schemin'
Nobody cares about you pocket's with no mics on
Don't be blind to yourself they might gon' be a pipe bomb
Fake shit it's like snail to the salt
In the nail to a coffin, somebody turn the lights on

You know whiteboys eat pussy like a sam-a-witch
Mmm like the sound of it
Let my tounge move around a bit
Shit better smell like ice cream though if it don’t then I won’t go down on it
But if it does I might drown in it

Backstroke, butterfly, have you on the bed scramblin'
Let me sip on this crown and then
A six pack and then sit back
Okay miss cat can I kiss that
Where them lips at

Lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat

And now you need to bring 'em into this world!

It’s getting hard to be me

Cause I’m the only person fucking with me!

Shhh-shut up motherfucker don’t disrespect these country ways, yeah!
Alabama, if yeen know, I ain’t hiding a damn thing, I just like to lean low
Yeah, I’m the theme show stereotypical beanpole
Slim, tall, tatted, let me add that I gotta green glow
From all the Mountain Dew that I consume from a mason jar
In a racing car, chase it with a tall ice brew
Let me not leave you confused, what I represent culturally
Trash bag full of freon, I’m huffin’ puffin’ on potpourri
That gummo’s squeaky swingin’ gate in front of that trap house

About ten Bodies on a fishing line with baby clothes on consignment
Came to the Game so broke that I still find one-dollar bills and get a thrill
That’s the kind of shit that leaves my pickle dill'd
Siding on the single-wide got icicle steel, too cold
Got a kerosene heater to heat up the grill, meatloaf?
Daddy’s in jail again for shuffling pills, we know
Man I’ve only come to give you a peep show, (In this world)
I run across the South Like a wild stream, smiling
I’ve seen more colorful mushrooms than a child’s dream on an island
Desolate left behind, cause my state is a state of grime

And take flight in this life, I'm a sight
Put a vice-grip lock on my right to fight
Despite the way you may feel about sights and sounds
That I might put down, about prices found on a sack of that white
Heaven is a place in a 7/11, I can never get away from hell
Found hell in the bible-belt, and found love in a 6-pack on the shelf
Went to the seashore to see more, but Leroy didn’t seem sure to me
So I took Leroy to Alabama, he bought the hat and bought the tee
Converted him y’all, I gave him convertible thoughts
When he saw that big buck hangin’ on the wall (Yeah)
I’m off by a millimeter, I’m on by a million light-years and 2 liters
A pint of moonshine, I ride in two-seaters
Take a ride (In this world)

Trailer Park Hollywood
20 ContributorsTrailer Park Hollywood Lyrics[Intro]
Heavy metal longsleeve made in 1988
Fake nugget wristwatch made in 1988
Dixie cup in the cup holder, shakin', makin' waves
Boom, boom, boom, got Jurassic Park 808's
Ooh, I'm Elvis Presley, 38's on 22's
Rhinestone jacket like Joshua Hedley
Yeah, I got that Honolulu
Flower power, bouquet, medley
'Bout to throw this Chevy in Tom Cruise
And go Trailer Park Hollywood, go Trailer Park Hollywood

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I got a styrofoam cooler full of cheap suds
Rock a necklace that I pulled off a sink plug
Bubba's in the corner chillin' with the mean mug
Permanently ill, never did clean drugs
Did he crack a smile or is it just cracker smiles?
That white trash hood shit, go deep with the crocodiles
That gummo celebrity mullet is fucking popping now
You laid on my vision, you out of touch like a pocket dial
Now hold up, open up the folder, look back in the rolodex
We repping that shit ever since your uncle was smoking boas
Ever since your crooked ass cop daddy, he pulled me over
And took my quarter bag of dope, 'cause he's a smoker
Fuck it, I got a lot where that came from
I know a couple grow spots where that came from
808's rattle in the seat where she came from
Yeah, I keep that bottom 'cause I know where I came from
Still Slum, bitch

Just like a nude velvet painting of a pinup girl

I still got the dice hanging from my rearview 'cause

Your mama's cigarettes hanging with her hair in curls
She's Trailer Park Hollywood, she's Trailer Park Hollywood
Just like a nude velvet painting of a pinup girl
We Trailer Park Hollywood, Hollywood

[Verse 2]
British nights, stepping through puddles and drinking Sprite
Baby blue dirt bike, kickstand and the kitchen lights
Diggin' through mama's vinyl collection to the smell of fried bologna's a ceremony
My religion is 'Bama life
No smoke in the mirror tricks, just dope in the mirror with
The seeds in the rolling tray and the box with the poker chips
The roach in the roach clip with the leather and feathers
The bellbottoms and aqua net, the hippies and heavy metal, uh
And the block is hot as a tea kettle
So much dope in the garage you can't park in it
These levels of underground made me a genius with keeping secrets
With a family that's scramblin' police radio signals
So what does your daddy do?
Punch in the clock and growin' pot in the paddy room
And you can't hang unless you get on his latitude
Hip-hop is my lane and rock and roll is my attitude
I stay country fresh, bitch
[Chorus]
Just like a nude velvet painting of a pinup girl
We Trailer Park Hollywood, we Trailer Park Hollywood
I still got the dice hanging from my rearview 'cause
I'm Trailer Park Hollywood, I'm Trailer Park Hollywood, Hollywood

Chill chill chill, let 'em rhyme, man
You know what it do man, just sit back, relax
Yelawolf what up?
Raekwon in the building

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
I'm Alabama's own, buddy
Flintstone Caprice, 1987 Cuddy
Backyard moonshine steel, methadone laboratory real
Can I keep it crystal clear?
Chipped tooth type of people
Illiterate pigs who wanna see you killed type of evil
Confederate flags, I see 'em
On a truck with the windows down
Why is he playing Beanie Siegel
Cause his daddy was a dope man
Lynyrd Skynyrd didn't talk about moving keys of coke man
Ain't no such thing as a free bird
Billy's got that street work
And he's packing a nasty heater
Trailer home trap spot
Chevys on the cinder blocks
Still doing donuts in the gravel parking lot
Gold ropes, cousins in a group home
And he knows every word to every Yelawolf song, bitch

They gon' have to X-File it, another nigga missing
Where he at? Shit, I don't know, Tupelo, Mississippi
Hey, somebody better help him or they gon' have to ship him
To the ER to see Abby, baby girl gon' snitch him
Throwing hundreds like I'm pitchin', I got it, I'm a rich one
Bet whatever I'm leaving this motherfucker with a thick one

Gangster Of Love
29 ContributorsGangster Of Love Lyrics[Intro]
Calling all cars, calling all cars
There is a gangster on the loose
He is very heavily armed and legged
And considered extremely dangerous
If you should happen to see him on your way home
Do not attempt to apprehend
I repeat, do not attempt to apprehend
Simply say "it's cool"

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Would the real Slim Shady please stand up
And tell these muthafuckers why I got signed?
'Cause I’m on the verge of slapping one of these white boys
Out here tryna imitate my grind
And if you feel offended when I say that
Fuck you, say something back
What do I gotta lose?
I’m already the underdog
Why wouldn’t I give you the opportunity to rap? Fuckboy
I’m harder than your momma’s fuck toy
And she’s still bitching
I’m sicker than a chicken sitting in shit
Sticking itself with a syringe in a Japanese kitchen, get some
I got the kinky bitch: get crumbs
Yeah, here the Shady clique come
They say I’m a dickhead, well it fits, why?
'Cause I'mma fuck this pussy ass game up till she gets numb
Any of many styles that I pick from
Fuck it, just give me kick drums
'Cause Yelawolf ain't a rapper
I’m a cataclysmic, culturally offensive, don’t-give-a-shit bum
It's done, so put ya money on a ‘Bama boy

You wanna ride in my lane

I got both wheels on a Harley blazin' a trail in the sunrays
Me and this lady, man, it's like church on a Sunday
I'm off of my rocker, but rock and roll is my papa
Raised me up on this gasoline, Billie Jean was my mama
Broken hearts turned to spoken art, my blood is like lava
Hard as a rock when I'm cold, yet I can flow just like water
Grew up with people that's lethal, grew up with hustling daughters
Mothers and fathers alike, like it or not when you saw us
Live my life like a rebel, the devil's hot on my tracks
But I won't run from my demons, no, I embrace them in fact
So remember my spirit when that Slumerican flag waves
From entrepreneurs to losers, users and runaways

Ready like a loaded gun
Sometimes I feel ready like a loaded gun

Keeps Me Alive
19 ContributorsKeeps Me Alive Lyrics[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Way back in Alabama where the dirt roads cut through the woods
And when it rains you can smell the steam off the grass
Even dew on the hood of my paw paw's 1985 Chevrolet Silverado
I must have been about six
Life was so easy back in the sticks
16 year old mother fought for the life she wanted for her son
Lookin' for love in the world of rock and roll is where it begun
It was Alabama, Ted Nugent
Alice Cooper, Randy Travis
Aerosmith kept my stepdaddy on the road
And life, it was madness
Cocaine and alcohol filled up the house party to be frank
It wasn't long before I tried it myself and then started to drink
School became boring and doing my homework became rollin' joints
Now I'm sixteen like my mama was when she had a little boy
Can't imagine that now as I look back 'cause I got three kids of my own
And I respect what she went through to pay for food and clothes
And a home
'Cause it ain't what she did, it's what she didn't do for me
That brought me to this moment
And made me who I am on this recording
And this is my story

[Chorus: Wynonna Judd]
This is my story
This is my glory
This is what keeps me alive
This is me flying
This is me trying

20 years old in the streets and I'm rollin' with gangsters now
Hip-hop is takin' over me, my language, my clothes, my lifestyle
Antioch, Tennessee put me through the school of hard knocks
And I carry that attitude with me to this day, more or not
And I'm young and hot-headed
Always running from police and skateboardin'
Graffiti, loiterin', I sorta got my peace from the chaos
Was no "mother-may-I's," surrounded by have-nots
And maybe some day I's well
I was against the grain, even when I was growin' wheat
Got back into rock and roll, and then got into poetry
Started expressin' everything I could through the medium of pen and pad
Playin' instrumentals off a tape and then over-dubbin' what I had
It was everything, because I had nothin'
And man that was alright, 'cause now I had somethin'
Little did I know that would be the hardest thing to do God ever put before me
So I took a look at what I've been through
And I made it my glory, and this is...

Leavin' Nashville, Tennessee for a nationwide tour
My bags are all packed and I'm loadin' my truck to go meet the crew
And I'm excited to get on the road, already one foot out the door
Turn around and it's my daughter, she's cryin'
'Cause daddy is leavin'
Knows that I'll be gone for months and it hurts and I hate to see it
Kneel down and tell her, "Look, baby, I promise I'll call you everyday
And daddy will send you a present from everywhere that we go play"
But that's not enough, and it's breakin' my heart in two
Just knowin' I can't stay, not even to see it through
And that I can't tuck her in, to say goodbye with a grin
Now she's bein' left behind, this is me all over again, man
I picked her up in my arms and held her tight
And said, "Hey you know what? Daddy used to be just like you
When I would walk up to the bus
And I'd do anything in the world for you, so chase your dreams
One day you'll use everything you've been through to be anything, baby girl

Daddy is up five AM again, it's a repeated scene
He's been at since ten
Nine to five hours don`t pay enough money
He took a third-shift and he's just gettin' in
Babies are hungry and mommy is bitchin'
'Bout bills that he need to go pay while he sittin'
Not even five minutes to drink a cold beer before hearing about what was left in the kitchen
Walk out the door for a walk to the store, bread was five dollars he only had four
Won't get a check til' the first of next week and he said to himself I can't take anymore
With no heat in the house and no gas in the truck, and his four-year-old's birthday about to come up
It's gun, mask, duct-tape, gloves, now

She's a single mother livin' in a hotel in the south side of the city
And she works at a bar in the strip to get tips savin' up for a place that is pretty
A twelve-year-old son to support, still in school with a father that's never around
He took her virginity, promised infinity
Then he took off and he hasn't been found
Most of the people she already knows
Have trouble survivin' and keepin' a home
That side of town ain't the place to raise a child
But she's doing her best and there's no where to go
Puts on a skirt, picks up her purse
He knows just what she does
His mama can't work at the bar every night
So his mama is hustlin' and sellin' drugs

Once upon a time not long ago
My grandmother told me one day I'd change
I felt like she was comin' down on me
So I told her no, I'd be the same
Not knowin' she was only tryin' to help
Motivate me to excel and climb
I was thinking she was the one trapped
While I was stuck in a cage of my mind
Man if I would've known what I know now
I would've brought my head down under the cloud
Told her thank you, and that I loved her
But I was too cool and too damn proud
What a fool I was, in fact
I've changed so much now lookin' back
I wish somebody I thought was cool
Was as cool as she was, when she told me that

[Hook]
I see you, the real you
Tryna' cover up whats inside of you
But everything you do is make-believe
Yeah you're hot, but you're too cool

Your boyfriend said it's a silly dream
But how can you dream, when you never sleep
You lookin' in the mirror and you're picturin' a light-show
A glimpse in the lens of a camera
Behind the scenes of life is a tightrope
Yeah you walk a thin line, but a thin line is all you need
A thin line in an indy movie
Just a break for somebody to see
The talent inside, the ballad of a diary you write
The by and by is just another day for a normal girl
But for you it's another day that you tried
Aside from the fact, that you ride in the back
Of a bus sometimes cause your car won't work
Well maybe you should take that bus to L.A
And put your dreams first, because...

[Hook]
I see you, the real you
Tryna' cover up whats inside of you
But everything you do is make-believe
Yeah you're hot, but you're too cool
I see you, oh
I see you, oh
I see you
[Verse 3]
Black and white
Everything is black and white, broke-down simple and plain
Most of us lost with a curious brain
Curiosity is looked at as strange
Stuck in a lane, but you can't complain
While you look at another passin' train
Wonderin' how, where's it going?
Wishin' you were inside, packed and rollin'
To another place but your time is chosen
To live low-key cause your dream is stolen
They don't understand, they believe in loathin'
Loungin', loafin', waitin', hopin'
Homie if the grass is greener, look, the gate is open
You waitin' for God to release the ocean
Sittin' on the beach, 2 feet from floatin'
(But I see you)

[Hook]
I see you, the real you
Tryna' cover up whats inside of you
But everything you do is make-believe
Yeah you're hot, but you're too cool
I see you, oh
I see you, oh

Lemonade Freestyle
21 ContributorsLemonade Freestyle LyricsRoll down the window in the Chevy
And I listen to the critics but they really wasn't sayin' shit
Buddy, I'm a gutter motherfucker from an Alabama creek
You don't know who you're playin' with
They talk so much that I bet one of these pebbles under me get laryngitis
The wave is so contagious, so who gave it, apparently I did
Put fish in the back of my boat, I'm a fisherman, I'mma reel 'em in, mackerel
I'mma give 'em ten minutes, then put 'em back in the water
There, just to see 'em all float
And kinda like mixtapes in the back of my trunk, buddy, yeah, I got 'em all sold
An Alabama with an arm and hammer, swimmin' in propaganda, I got 'em all, whoa
Promenade, country boy, get out of my way, gallon of sweet tea, a packet of lemonade
Smackin' a faggot, I crack a bat on the pen and page, no homo, anyway
Any stage, rip it any way, the independent way, look, have you seen his Js
Footwork, send 'em in a rage, feelin' like a millionaire on minimum wage
Don't need a Mercedes to take your girl, my Chevy is sick, Earl
I let her play with my mullet, while she sip syrup
Hold up, Alabama funk make you lose your teeth like a Mountain Dew soda
Some saltines wanna live in the box
But guess what, I'm the cracker who showed up
And we could take it to Dakota, small towns, we can take it over
Yeah, ten million rocks, bet it up, we can make it a boulder
A shadow's hangin' over your shoulders, and we about to roll that over
And when the bitch come flyin' down the hill, you better burn wheels like somebody told ya
Keys, goin' to grab 'em, Shits Creek, don't leave the paddle
Get a poncho for the rain of battles, go Tonto, go get the saddle
Cause I been on my travels since Adam bit the apple
Feelin' like I got the biggest dick in the world and I can't even fit a Magnum
My mama smokin' weed like a chim-i-ney, call her Ma Marley
Like yeah mon, yeah we got trees and a couple kegs if you wanna party
Right here mon, pop a trunk, Papa Doc, we know you don't give a fuck

Okay, okay

I'm  pullin' that chopper out that driveway, the tires leavin' prints
My  denim is bloodstained still, last night was a close range hit
Bar room is emptyin' smoke, billowing from the chimney tip
Back wall of the concrete drips, Creek Water in the flask, it get sipped
Okay,  these bitches acting rude, bandana is tied on my head
Got  a knot in that knapsack, hangin' out the side, you see red
Opiate Taylor is trashy, Slumerican born to be trashy
They  took my ass to the city, I just don't know how to act classy
Black feather hangin' out that hat, just so them punks see me comin'
From a tribe called broke, so I'm not breakin' or runnin'
Fuck all that racism, bitch, and who the fuck you roll with
I'm  a white boy from the South, but I'm on some new South shit

Gotta get my cut like a pocket knife for the bucket off top, and yeah
Bitch, to the rim, no more fishin' for brim

I’m a car wreck in a swamp I drown victims slow with these words that I lay
Pigs on the corner got an eye for my kind cause we ignore laws everyday

They bids so long by the time they get to come home

And baby mama that was tight in that thong

Pay for it cash her ass is gone
She never worked so the stash is gone

[Verse 1]
Runnin' like a fool, I got a new demo-tape
Headed to a label on a low-key dope race
Gotta be on time, gotta go do show - faced
Can't be late, gotta go photo take
Manager want me to do a song for the whole place
Without a microphone, DJ, and no stage
So I put my pride inside my pocket to hold safe
Knowin' inside of my heart these people are so fake
Pictures of New York, skyliners are back-dropped
23 floors up down lookin' at cab tops
I’m so fucking nervous, that I can’t even act not
Thinkin jumpin' out this window ain’t such a bad drop
Smackin' the blacktop, cuz I’m not a have-a-lot
I’m just a have-not
Is it my time? And am I lookin' at that watch?
It could be the end of it all, maybe my last shot
But I got a funny feeling it ain’t right
I tell my manager, but he just thinkin it’s stage-fright
Minus the fuckin sweat that’s drippin off of my face
I realize if I do it, then it’s only for a price
So am I lookin' at a hook wit the bait, bite?
Am I the big catch? A dinner for late night?
Do they realize I’m in terrible shape, right?
Can’t even afford to get my little boy a bike
I sit down in front of LA Reid
The president of Def Jam, the boss before me
And to my left is KP and 30 of A&R's who work for him
He said Yelawolf is an emcee from Alabama
Yelawolf you can have the floor and
I told him if you wanna see me sing
Come catch me tourin' but I ain’t performin' for the fame

Money comes and goes just like the fallin' rain
Better leave a bucket outside and collect the change
Someday we’ll look back and think what have we gained?
And I hope we can say
More than fame

[Verse 2]
What’s the use in complaining about the decision I made?
If it’s rainin' (Then it's rainin')
Then fuck it, pull the umbrella out, hey that’s entertainment (Entertainment)
I’m above it and focused
Got a lot of shows I gotta go hit
In the back of my mind I’m thinkin, "Did I blow it?" (Did ya blow it?)
Did you notice all the people you roll with
Are losing their focus because of my ego (My people)
‘Cause I’m hopeless, won’t listen to nobody
They sit and go on about how I won’t make it (You won't make it)
If I keep fuckin' up relationships with executive folks
With these checks to cut for deals, I’ll be broke then
Stuck in the south with nothing but my old shit
Ain't no new whips, new house, new clothes
New dough, you know you gotta go face it
Look who in the eyes, say I’m sorry for fucking up
These rappers are coming up
What you gonna do about it?
Just sit back and watch 'em and get up
And make a move about it, be about it
See it’s about the way you committed, now you got to go-and-get it
I got a question
Are you strong enough? Answer:
"Fuck yeah!"
I ain’t about to be another white-boy stuck here
Hit the road, do any fuckin' show that I could get overseas, let's go!
Canada, let’s go
South by South-West
Yelawolf Expo, killed that
Made it my
Focus, let’s roll
Now every label and their mamma tryin' to get a hold
None of 'em had me, and here come Interscope

Yea
Then I got a deal
You know?
I don’t know
I guess integrity goes a long way man
Gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em

Good Love
11 ContributorsGood Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just another lonely night stuck in this hotel
The hallways quiet and the lobby is so empty
Broke that seal in the mini bar in my room
Looking for a lady to come spend time with me
She's sending me pictures to my iPhone
I can't lie girl, I am so impressed
Come show me how you get into your zone
See you in an hour, here's my hotel address
She brought a bottle of Jack D, oh my
Now that's one less thing I gotta go buy
She got a leather jacket and a t-shirt
She got cowboy boots and a mini skirt
She rolls up, asks do I mind
Baby I don't mind if you get high
Let's drink and smoke, yeah, that's alright
And tear this room apart all night

[Chorus]
Ohhhh, she got the good love
Ohhhh, she got the good love
No more leather jacket or a t-shirt
No more cowboy boots or a mini skirt
Ohhhh, she got the good love

[Verse 2]
She's a Beretta, no, more like a Smith and Wesson
Pull a Revolver, each bullet loaded with poison
Father, forgive your daughter, she came to me for the slaughter
I took no time for the second guess, I said yes and I oughta
Automatic, the heart's erratic, I'm radical at the radest
And smashin' that ass from the back and crackin' the packaging of a prophylactic
Fuckin' and suckin', soakin' up a mattress
I'm so in love with this moment, roll up the dope
And pack the bowl and fire it up
Be like cocaine, get wired up
Freaky-deeky-leeky, these sheets are getting tied up
[?] put your feet higher
You can do [?] I'll take you high up
I'm coming up out of a fuckin' pigeon hole
So let's get wicked and kick it and get a witness for a video
Give me a kiss up on your tippy toes
I'll put your back on the wall
Make you feel like a natural woman
I’m gunnin’, she’s runnin’, I'm gunnin’ until she cummin’
I teach what I preach, come meet the Chief for a sermon
Report back to your friends, give them a survey, a verdict
Give them a grade for the lay, but you ain't gotta encourage
The purrin' kitty cats, cuz if you give it, I give it back
I'm outta the city tomorrow, no need to get attached
Baby, my love is only skin deep
You keep a G, maybe when I come back
I'll see you and be friendly

Catfish Billy mane, harder than a pinecone
Hoppin' off an aeroplane, dropped in your time zone
Trailer park pimp shit, I don't want the red rope
Fuck all the report cards, bitch, I know that I'm dope
We know how to get bud, some of them do cocaine
Take it to the moshpit, gang, gang, gang, gang
Tailor made boots on 'em, shotgun shell hot
Do it for the slums now, from the AL dot
Rock from a slingshot, straight to the target
Window on the Honda, in the black market
Coulda been a crime boss, playin' with a full deck
I don't care about the cost, now the red alert full threat
'Cause you know that I'm dope

Used to be a bad mouth, runnin' 'round the house
Sayin' words that I shouldn't and I got it from my folks
If I got caught, I would end up in my room
Set down 30 minutes with the mouth full of soap
Put it all on paper, go to sleep
Then I wake up with the same bad mouth I was sent to bed fo'
Now I make a livin' sellin' all the bad words to the kids like me
Who would grow to be dope

Feet in the reptiles and my head's on cloud nine
Took a hit of dab now and I don't have no mind

Got up in his alleyway, set the Harley down now

Polka dot bullet holes, you don't wanna clown now

Clique got the loud pipes, you know that we does
Wind in the trees split, all of them leaves up
Mobbin' like an army, fuck boy freeze up

If I had one dream that I could dream at all
I'd pass out drunk on the floor with the lights on
Go to sleep on the single-wide carpet and take off
Put my Gold plaque up on every hater's wall
'Cause I was raised in a place where
People don't believe that anything is possible

I'm feelin' real good in this motherfucker
Snakeskin boots and a old mesh trucker
Faded blue jean vest with the back marked with 1-9-7-9
Turquoise on the knuckles
Pocket full of credit cards, no limit, though
Swipe it 'til I need to replace new strips
Got the no-touch Amex metal
Should've left the dealership with a new whip
Long way from the trap like a loose bear
Flipped a couple new styles with the new hair
Little bit of rock and roll like a rockin' chair
I'm back and forth like the windchime in the air

At Waffle House and rob me for that sack, I'm good
Seventeen, tryna make a couple bucks
So we can jump fresh in a pair of new duds
Tough lesson on the block, little did he know
I stood with a blade hid down in the bush
Probably should've killed the boy
But the adrenalin runnin' through my heart was enough not to push
Just knowin' I could
Change the rest of my life and how I saw shit
I could either be the young king of a small town
Or shake it off and rise up above it
Been dissed by the most liked kids
Since I don't know when, shit, don't remember when it
Was a time when I fell in line with the in-crowd
Shit, how, in a school that's public?
With a mama like, "Fuck it"
Black eye from the bully, I got busted
If I didn't hit him back, got another smack
Dried up, two tears in a bucket
I love my mama for that
I remember lovin' drama 'til the drama come back to tenfold
And wonder why I'm stuck in a Pinto
See now I'm gettin' money, but you know that I've been broke
It took a lotta karma, had to fix the dent, though
'Cause I was wreckin' life's only one vehicle, myself
Now I buckle up and I hit roads
Not for lack of mistakes, but what I did with those
Sometimes I gotta jump on my soapbox
I feel responsible for tellin' y'all folks these things
Success ain't obtained by what others around you think
Get out of your own way, get after the green

I just popped some pills
And all I want to do is not to feel
Like a fucking ball on a soccer field
‘Cause everybody seems so not for real
While this moon is up
I want to ride around with you in the truck
I hope you don’t mind I assumed you was
‘Cause I went and got a room for us
So let’s drink some drinks
Until we get so drunk we can’t wait
To pull each other’s clothes off and get na-ked
And make the motherfucking Chevy shake

[Verse 2]
Now I’m feeling fine in my 1979
Trunk full of knock and the cup with the lime
And I think that it’s about that time
So give me a shot
I’mma take it up to the mountain top
Or we could make it bounce in the parking lot
Straight up in a police parking spot, fuck the cops
We can roll, all over the city we can go
Anywhere you want to, creeping low
Baby I just want to beat the show
So fuck that room
‘Cause I got the Chevy engine tuned
And I’ll keep it running just for you

Betcha he takes it like a motherfucking ho

Yeah I'm Southern, I'm crazy

Holler at chee, burning tires
I'm trashy, but I'm fire (yeah)
I'll stick em good, I'll show 'em up
I'll show 'em hood and I don't give a fuck
From the trailer park
I hail king, don't get ate apart
So watch your spelling
In the evening they ring-a-ling-ling
Cellular blowing up they wanna ding-a-ling
I'm a leading scene
The pimp of the leading team
We number one over seven Dixie Mafia family

[Hook]
My rattling trunk got them bobble heads looking
Rear view mirrors got the world sitting crooked
I am kick- kicking, kick- kick- kick- kicking
Kick- kicking, kick- kick- kick- kicking
These twelve inch speakers, these six inch tweeters
I'm playing those heaters, I got that beater
I am kick- kicking, kick- kick- kick- kicking

All The Way Up
16 ContributorsAll The Way Up Lyrics[Intro: Yelawolf]
Let the band play
Yeah, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
I hardly expected to target you bitches
I guess it's time for me to whip it (Time for me to whip it)
Whip it out on you like I got Tourette's with a weapon
Now who's gonna fill it? (Fill it?)
I ain't no battle rapper, I'm a war veteran
Of course I gotta get him, the chord, the sentiment
With the floor, the residence gold, pure gold
What am I saying? That I am rich
That I got a lot of pretty shit
No, I'm not, but, yes, I do
'Cept I don't need no compliments
Just complimentary head from your lady when I'm in Paris, thanks
That's Oman and Paris colors on my drip, bitch, don't touch the wet paint, uh
Impala lookin' like a bowl of water that just spilled all over the pavement (Trill)
Cook-up in the mop top, motherfucker, that's rocks
Slumerican made men (Trill)
Somebody opened up the door to the Chevy, let Yelawolf out of the cage-in
I'ma walk through the club in some alligator hide, you would think it was Cajun
If you still hating, your pussy's on display then
My bulls are on parade and my machine is always raging
Them boys, they got that Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Page'n
You think you 'bout it 'bout it now
'Til a pack of my hounds crawl out of that basement

[Verse 2: MopTop]
Ayy, I gotta do the speed limit, look, trust me
Cutting the hair, tryna give it a mullet
Pocket Rick Ross, baby, I think I'm hustlin'
Dope was so strong, made the J hit the dougie
Don't want the recognition, just the money
Strap always with me, I'm keeping it currently
Bae get it with me, ain't takin' it from me
She on the board like Coyote Ugly
Woke up and ate, lit like dentist
It's lookin' like you haven't ate in a minute
And how it seems, at the rate that we winnin'
Yeah, the Slumboy go to state to you niggas
Draymond with the Draco, turn your fitted cap to a halo
Las Veg' flow, I don't gamble, but your best bet is to lay low, okay
You might get whiplash, whip pass
Ride 'til the whip crash, Six Flags
Pistol no kick back, get back
Get 'em smart like zigzag real fast
Pull up like a gym class, gym bag
Turnin' up to the max, make 'em feel that
I been doing kickback, get racks
Run it all the way up on they bitch ass
[Chorus: Yelawolf]
I'm all the way up, don't let your pride get you folded 'cause

You all the way wrong, go back to sleep, get nice and cozy
'Cause I'm all the way up, woah, all the way up, turnt

[Verse 3: CookUp Boss]
I just keep working my wrist
I got no time for these bitches
They treatin' me like I'm a star
I can't stay out of my kitchen
I used to re-up on Liston
And piece 'em on Eighth
I come from straight out the projects
Now I'm Slumerican made
CookUp Boss, I'm not a rapper
I represent for all the trappers
Balling hard like I'm a pastor
On the low, dirty bastard
Used to be broke, I'm up now
Wolf call a play, it's a touchdown
Ain't nothin' fuckin' with us now
Nigga want smoke then it's up there
I'm here to make the trap great again
I want the front and the backend
I got my rank and my bank up
My migo need somewhere to back in
I'm so addicted to trappin'
Niggas keep tellin' me tap in
I see the hate in your face
Trife Life got they ass in 'cause...

On a jacket, a pistol, and a packet of blow darts
If you enter my scope, you gonna need a strong heart
Strong art, the heart of Dixie got history
You sittin' on 32's we sittin' on 60's

Fuck a new coop when you need a new roof
Give me the whole stake from the ruler to the two
Give me the ruler too, measure it up
Theres good money in the pyrex mesurin' cup
Ricky Bobby's on the corner he's tearin' it up
If he don't slow down, he'll be wearin' a crutch

Catfish Billy Goat
Really though... (Haha)
Yeah!

[Verse]
I must... I must be a fucking goat
The way this chain is hanging off my throat
Warming up my vo-cals
Need somewhere to hang my coat y'all
Ray-Bans on my face, bitch I ain't looking at you, ho
But my guess is she would exit this shit with me, no, I know, yes I know
But fuck that shit! So pardon my French and English too
But fuck that also, cos I wanna hollow out my cuss words out on you
Gucci Gang, Gucci Gang, Gucci Gang, Pootie Tang
Taking you over to the  studio and do my thang
I am dope, jump on this track like Kangaroo Jack
Aboriginal boomerang, I am dope
Left, right, left, right, soldier step right up
I'm airtight, fuck your stair flight
I'm prepared like, I'm not scared like fuck your hairline up!
Barber school, see I got haters by the carpool
They say I changed, that's because I got a jar full
You primates, monkey ass, white boys lyin' fake
Oh you a hip hop head? Bitch, your first record was Kanye
You just on a blind date
You get dumped with the rest of 'em
When this current trend is over with--
I'll still be on my way
Yeah, that laughable trend's like detachable friends
Them fuckers show up to party
But when that party does end, they Gone with the Wind
So I hope that song that you spin makes you enough bread to retire
Better watch what you spent
Anyway, that shit is dead like any day
All I'm saying is regenerate and penny save
If you swag surfing then certainly you'll ride any wave
And you're already dead, homie, so pick any grave
I pledge allegiance to the Slumerican flag
Ten stars for every letter
Lighting bolts to lead the path
For the slums I represent
From the laundromats of cash, from growing dope illegally
Break the law and get the bag
Yeah, and take the saw and cut the slabs
You build your house with straw and mud
That when it rains your roof will sag
Dag, take the crawl before you run, that pace right there will win the race
So run the laps and not the drag
But what do I know, Fido?
If you're a dog, I'm a dog
We're just two frogs on a log singing in the moonlight till the DJ hits pause
Or my body pit falls
From the whisky sip, then I'm empty and tall
Till the ink pen don't draw
Put until then, friend, I'm gonna need another pen, dawg
Cos I’m a highly orchestrated life aboard the Earth
I’m guided by the light, the light is inside the word
The brightest candle with the thickest wick
Melanin is irrelevant‬
I hear the kick, hat, snare, that there hits my soul, bro
That's why I go hard on beats and also get down with dough bros
What the fuck, I'm too hard for lumberyards
I'm too sick for cancer sticks
Built that bridge to come across
A ghett-o philanthropist
Hustle hand over fist
A pro-phylactic, no chauvinist
Oh Jay no, fuck I'm smooth as shit (polished!)
And don't shoulder nits
Never made it to college...
But I made it to Shady!
Gave myself no other options
"Yela, you're dreaming, ya crazy!"
I saw the gap in the options
The South is an orphan and lazy
Nobody wanted to father it
So I made it my baby!
Your rockabye the Rock and try and mash it all up
And who the fuck am I!?
Didn't reinvent the wheel
I just threw spokes up under that Monster truck and rideeeeee
Sorry about the oil stains that I left on the road
If you slip and fall on the shit I talk, then I guess you're the run of the joke... (run of the joke)

It maybe years until they see and feel

You've got to earn your invite...

You got daddy issues, I got daddy issues
Let's go get a bottle and see what it will do
Mama told you not to jump, mama ain't the only one
But I give you parachutes, I just wanna have some fun
Takeoff on the dirt runway, no concrete
Your chaos is the only way to my peace

Father’s Day
18 ContributorsFather’s Day Lyrics[Spoken intro]
I just thought it was appropriate to, uh
Just to give a shout out, or show my appreciation to all the fathers
Cause I hear a lot of rappers say or brag about not having kids but
Guess what? I do
So I'd like to send this record out to all the daddies
You know the real daddies, taking care of shit

[Verse 1]
This one’s for the skateboarders, emcees, b-boys like me
Street artists in magazines, DJs with babies
Working hard, you never sleep, never get to spend they time at home
Send that money but you never see him
Always working, daddy’s gone
To the brick laying, dirt digging
Burger flipping in the fucking kitchen
Just to get that check on Friday
So you could bring back home what was missing
Everyday is feed my kids day
End of the month is rent day
And if you don’t get back to work on time
They tax you for that month’s break
For the d-boys holding weight
And for the daddies who are locked away
Doing time cause you was doing crime
But you was only trying to put down a plate
Maybe to get some baby J's
In the 80s, hey, that’s how we raised
And to the men feeding a friend's child
When that friend has passed away
I've got to say
You might also like[Spoken]
Yeah, to all my closest friends
And all the father figures in my life
You know I really, I just wanna say thank you
Yo, for real

[Hook]
Happy father’s day
No matter how you getting paid
You hustle hard, you show the way
Happy father’s day

[Verse 2]
Tell my mama not to worry about me
Cause I ain’t never had a second to forgive my dad
I can’t help but to believe in myself
It's not really a choice but a matter of being a real dad
When I came to the world I knew I had a talent
But I never would imagine I would be a young dad
And I grew up like a weed overnight, through the crack in the concrete
Look at me, young daddy
Tell me how to walk away from a child
And I’ll tell you how to walk away from a million dumb daddy
If you can walk away from a million bucks then you never gave a fuck
You a dumb luck, dad
To look up and see a man above you
To tell you that you ain’t invisible, that’s a motherfuckin' daddy
Somebody to push you, and teach you how to fight
If you didn’t fight, fuckin right, that's a good dad
Gotta take a second now show love to the trailer park apartment hood dads
A man who ain’t got a lot but in a minute he would drop it all
Do anything he could do daddy
Jesus, when I go to see every baby mama who never had a real dad
Don’t take it out in the baby or maybe even the man when he’s only trying to become
A real daddy
[Spoken]
…cause it ain’t easy
But it’s a blessing man
Makes you work hard
To all the hard workers out there
I just wanna say

[Hook]
Happy father’s day
No matter how you getting paid
You hustle hard, you show the way
Happy father’s day

So Long
11 ContributorsSo Long Lyrics[Intro]
You was just a baby girl looking for a new job
I was a typhoon, a cartoon for you to watch
Took you by the belt loop, said "How can I help you?"
How can I assume you would tie me in two knots?
How can I assume you would tie me in two knots?
How can I assume you would tie me in two knots?

[Chorus]
All the shit that we went through
Wasn't worth holding on
And you said "So long"
And I said "So long"
All the shit that we went through
Wasn't worth holding on
And you said "So long"
And I said "So⁠—"

[Verse 1]
You must've been sick of my shit and I never seen it
You must've saw the demon that slipped and then got between us
I thought I was invincible to you inside my zenith
I told you to leave but you know I never really mean it (Mean it)
Yeah, good idea, real fuckin' genius
Leave the one person behind whose love for you is the cleanest (Cleanest)
Or to see whose trash is clingin' to my bullshit
When in fact my grass was the greenest
But me and that bottle was a repeat song
I drug you down that road and the road was long
But I'm about as wrong as one man can be wrong
And all I wanna do now is come back home
'Cause I love you

[Verse 2]
99 bottles of pain killers all gone
99 reasons I gave you to leave me alone
99 days in a slump, three months and no call
I got 99 problems and I'm the reason for them all
Still the son of a bitch you met, still drinking myself to death
Still stuck tryna find my father, the search isn't helping yet
I sent you a seldom text at night when I seldom rest
But you closed the curtain on me, now I'm just a silhouette
I felt like an animal, but an animal's not a pet
Yeah, it's all fun and games until water's running red
I don't know why I had to hurt myself just to feel regret
But I need you, just tell me that your love isn't finished yet, damn

[Chorus]
All the shit that we went through
Wasn't worth holding on
And you said "So long"
And I said "So long"
All the shit that we went through
Wasn't worth holding on

Took you by the belt loop, said "How can I help you?"
How can I assume you would tie me in two knots?
How can I assume you would tie me in two knots?
How can I assume you would tie me in two knots?1Embed

No Hands
22 ContributorsNo Hands Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, Ghet-O-Vision, Slumerican, Shady, bitch, yeah

[Hook]
Look mama, no hands
I’m standing on top of a motherfucking hundred grand
They took a shot, Airball
You think I give a fuck about you pussies? Not at all
Yela, how’s it going?
Oh man, I’m standing on top of the motherfucking hundred grand
They took a shot, Airball
You think I give a fuck about you pussies? Not at all

[Verse 1]
Ain’t no reason to quit, what the fuck I look like?
To put a cease and a desist on this heat that I spit, shit, bitch!
I believe in my wits enough to believe on my kids
Won’t be home 'til Christmas
Chevy’s on the wish list, no Santa Claus, no ma’am, no problems
I’m stuck in play like a fair ball
Know you love to call it "fouls" and "hip hop ain't in the south"
But this country rap tunes
Got a bitch in the back room with a open mouth, ah!
But sacrifice it all and lord knows it
With my life on the bullseye
Make a camera jealous of my focus
And that’s Shady if you ain’t noticed
The thing's loaded, I put that on my great granddaddy named Otis
In a traffic jam, I got my lane open
Play the game with the same token
You did and crack the bank open
When they said the rap game was in the drought
I was swimming in so much dope I had to break my life jacket out

Get a work out bitch, run your lips
I know you’d dig a hole six feet deep with a spoon
Just to see me trip
You window shopping and can’t see the gift
When the shit is sitting in front of your face
Like cement in between the bricks
If the world had name for me, I’d be Slumerican
This whole shit started out with, bitch bet I can
And I do it with Casio and a farmers tan and
On the top of the hundred grand, uh, bet I stand
And I made it through 'cause I had heart
Waking up to roaches in my cereal box
Buddy, that’s a bad start
Food stamps in the Pathmark
When some of these bitch-ass rappers would take a dick to say they had it hard
Don’t make one of these slums come intercept you
Enter your dorm room and punk you, you internet goons
I'm spring loaded with the salt of an old man drinkin' a fifth
And steering with my knee in an old van like hey

A couple of loose screws ain’t stopping a train from moving
A couple of bucks short of a bill and I'm still one hundred proofing
Under the heat like I been metal roofing
In a trench coat and a black hoody, head banging to heavy metal music
I’m now on, thank God, 'Bama it's on
Throwing rocks out the window on 20, that’s a milestone
Hello tomorrow, yesterday is now gone
I dedicate this song to me, fuck how wrong
Shoe laced up, with the mainstream face up
With the same team that I came up with
Mayne what!?
Changed the game up like a change up
With a pain that'll drain on to
Bitch you better remain tough
Mayne what!?
Used to help Weezy pack up a 50 pounds
Green bay packin' a bowl up, a broke soul packin' a couch
'Cause the landlord used to kick me out
But I went from packing my house to packing the house, biiiitch

Is that really what you want?
Cause I got what you want in my pocket
Hand me the keys
I'll hand you the sun
Is that really what you need?
Cause I got what you need in my rocket ship

Ladies in lines to pick from. (Four)
Yep, and I'm wondering, which one, (Three)
Whatever moves best to the kick drum. (Two)
Get me to the moon, it's this one. (One)

One, two, three, feet and rising
There are five I wanted to plug one
Hey, the day in L.A.'s got soul
It's Night in Alabama do you want some sun?
So, what's a 20 minute flight pulling your boots like Napoleon Dynamite
We'll work it up while we work up an appetite
Looking at Earth from my personal satellite
Got it right

Going up - take a breath
It's a giant leap for all mankind
But for us it's just a simple step, baby step

Shop, shop, Yelawolf, Yelawolf
Yeah, buddy, I'm a trailer park household name, uh
I ain't gotta work another day in my life
I can't complain
But fuck a retirement plan
Still lookin' at Jim like, "You hirin', man?"
Took a vacation and spent half of the time
Pacin' the floor, divisin' a plan
Gotta relax
But I got a big loan, holmes, gotta repay RE/MAX
Got it all pent up, gotta get these bucks
So I don't end up in a ski mask
I'ma lift that truck, I'ma sniff these drugs
I'ma go back homе where the hеat at
Took a look at the hill, baby, I got real
When I get to the top, I'ma ski back
Like a Canadian, send it
Give a fuck what you play and what's trendin'
Billy's on a parade again with his

I party like a rock star, you seen me, ho
Henny where I put in work, best believe it ho
See, I am not a rapper, although, I'm something else
So I'ma turn it up a notch 'cause I don't need these niggas help
Fuck y'all, not you, I mean all of y'all
I'm ESPN with this rappin' shit, check my stats on how I ball
My elevator goin' up, I'm never slowin' up
'Cause they gon' need a little more than lean 'cause I'm never givin' up
I'm focused like I'm on some Adderall
I got no rear view and no brakes and I'm runnin' out of patience

Look at all this blood on my hands, look at all these hands on my plate
Niggas that say that they real, they be the first ones to hate
Look at all the shit in my life, did a lot of dirt to get stripes
But at the end of that night still need more than sacrifice
I'm the soul of Orlando, Cortez Phillips my family
We still goin' commando, any business get handled
Once the picture is painted ain't no way we can swerve
Get out what we put in, everything we deserve
Feelin' good, feelin' great, flights in and out of state
Must be in my DNA the way I keep this shit straight
Fist full everyday, clips full everyday

Uh, kinda like a Friday I feel, kinda like a highway I feel, yeah
Hard white like a coke deal, rollin' with a spoke on the front wheel
Harley in the wind, I'm tuned in, leather grips underneath my rings
My teeth bling, permanent pirate, slum to the dirt, crown me king
Imperial poet, lace my bud with LSD, picture me floatin'
At sixteen played with the Ouija Board 'til the Devil lost his focus
Mental wars built me up, veteran soldier, pistol totin'
Sharp as a sickle, drippin', broken, wish you would, I ain't hopin'
Like a creek to an ocean eventually connects
I found my way into that wave and rode it with respect
Now some of these country boys are rappin' but have no intellect
No introspective on the genre, just out there for that check
But fuck the world, I'm no lie detector and if your conscience does not affect ya
Then slide ya products out, find investors to monetize the lies you perfected
That's a slippery slope to no end, but, hey, that's the way it goes then
After the show they close in when you're burning the wick at both ends

Now he's a maniac, pack of serrated blades
Carvin' his name into his skin in a perverted way
Went from a chicken to a bird of prey
Went from a spark in the kitchen to an uncontrollable flame
That fully auto was tame, now it's reloaded, cocked, and aimed

Fuck Me
16 ContributorsFuck Me Lyrics[Intro]
You know forgiving somebody
Is probably the hardest thing you can do in the world
Forgiving somebody for fuckin’ you up
Fuckin’ up your heart
But I ain’t gonna lie man
Asking for forgiveness, shit, is hard too

[Verse 1]
I don’t know why you treat me just like a scumbag
When these bitches ain’t shit to me but an autograph
I thought we were bigger than that, I thought we would last
But you just think that I’m an Alabama piece of trash
Just like my dad, out lookin’ for a piece of ass
Motel 6, a bitch, get a piece and dash
All these problems, they add up like I need the math
But I’d rather divide if it equals bad
Multiply the dividends, it's an evil trap
Plus you never impressed much, minus the bags
I never knew Chanel before I knew you
I knew Wal-Mart and Dickies suits
But if it made you happy I would shop and go
So you could feel all the class of Kennedy’s Jackie O
Remember when Bob said you were out of my league
I just couldn’t believe it I just couldn’t conceive
I should have jumped from that fuckin’ boat or maybe put a blade to my throat
‘Cuz I can never be the one you need, be the man of your dreams
I’m a fuckin’ nightmare, a prisoner of the scene
So maybe you need somebody who doesn’t believe in dreams
Or maybe you hate yourself as much as I hate me

Fuck you, that’s all I ever wanna do
All I ever wanna do is fuck you

But if I catch you in the street with another man
Holdin’ his hand, I'mma fuck him up
I ain’t never had nobody like you
I don’t know what to do with myself
I feel like maybe I should give it up
But I can’t, I’m so in love with you that I can’t see further than right now
And right now I need to fill my cup
Drink my pain away again to wake-up to needin’ you
Like I never needed anything, but this relationship (relationship)
...Relationship
...Fuck

[Verse 2]
You either let the past go, and let us grow
Or let us not, and let it stop, you gotta let me know
I put this ink in my own blood, give a fuck about who sees
What do I gotta lose but my own soul?
No one loves you like I do and no one ever will
I said you were the coolest, but you need to chill
‘Cuz if you leave me lyin’ hurt from some lyin’ jerk
I'mma bring my iron to the church like Kill Bill
And fuck up somebody for my baby
Fuck up somebody for my baby
Everybody’s dyin’, the preacher, the bride's maidens
‘Cuz none of you motherfuckers can live up to my lady
Why can’t you see that I’m not shady?
I wouldn’t fuck around on you, never no baby

You will stop worryin’ about what I do lately...

Hi kids! (Come out and play)
Do you like Primus? (Catfish)

[Verse 1]
I was gonna do one of those kind of freestyles
You know the jack for beat shit
Practical rapper's speed dial
Automatic attention
And sniff out an MP3 file, murder it
Throw a dead body at your feet and say, “ See how?”
But then I thought, hey, what the fuck is the use?
I got drunk and listened to Primus, then took it into the stu
I looped it up for a minute then grabbed the pen
And began and these menacing mental sentences started syllable groups
That’s over the top, I’m too explanatory
But my catalog of music is well, mandatory
Wanna appreciate what I made on that Love Story?
Look at my history and the history of recording because

[Hook 1]
I popped out the wood like a pine cone
Dropped in that Alabama time zone
Popped the shotgun then a microphone
Oops, pop the trunk, now your mind's blown

You gotta picture this little bitty ass idiot
Running ‘round with a hideous group of sinning, oblivious
Hicks smokin’ a roach and then sniffing gas out of Hemis
With garden hoses
Poking holes into my old jeans
One of those nightmarish, impossible teens
But I was a young prophet to be seen
Listenin' to some Skynyrd, then Ozzy, then Billie Jean, hmm
Somebody should have seen my great escape
Cause I went from pressing my troubles to pressing play on a tape
My appetite for destruction was pushing me to my fate
And then The Beastie Boys put me up on that 808

[Hook 2]
It's over with, I'm a vocalist, I can fucking see it
Two thousand people in front of me singing what I'm singing
This redneck, slum shit, mixed with this shit's amazing
What a concept, but my name is Mud

[Verse 3]
Damn right mister Claypool
I couldn't have said it better,  you're like an angel
I'm not as accepted as I expected
Through my perspective in front of the sexes
And I didn't get elected
Like Charlamagne Tha God fuckin' hates me
Man, wish I felt accomplished by having such a prestigious
Over achieving genius like Charlamagne to complain about me
Why can't somebody whose really done something doubt me?
That's hard luck, fuck it, I'm used to kickin' buckets
I'm used to pickin' up sticks for the general public
I don't know how being white is such a sensitive subject
It ain't like I'm the kind of white like a Jimmy Buffet
Or mother fuckin' geek undeserving of credibility
I'm realer than most of these rappers ever was or will it be's
I don't sell dope and I don't ask why
I don't pin, fuck quotes, and I don't sell lies
[Skit]
Yelawolf, man he changes, man he's so weird
He went from wearing a mohawk to fuckin' rocking a beard, in a year
And now he's over that, what is he gonna do?
And I saw him on Instagram and he's rockin' some cowboy boots?

[Verse 4]
I feel great, you should get a pair
My DJ's got a pair of rattlesnake skin boots, he's outta here
We like being not like you, that's the point
Besides I look amazing, Baby, roll me a joint
And I don't even smoke no more
I just feel like Willie Nelson more than I have before
So turn the music up a mother fuckin' tad bit more
And prepare yourself for another Shady smash of course
I ain't one of these artists, clearly that stickin', they never change
I love opening doors, exploring parts of my brain
Reflected externally through my clothes, views and style
And it takes a hell of  heart to do it in front of a crowd
Pardon me while I start a new chapter inside my book
It's a feeling of pure enjoyment to sing you another hook
To look on your face when you hear it, the shit that I created
It's amazing and I can feel it, believe it I can relate, but

[Hook 3]
Don't be a hater on the fucking clock
Trimmin' fat takes time, just wait, watch
These rappers really think they got shit locked
But they gonna know about me when my album drops
Love Story
I’ll give it to you motherfuckers when daddy comes home5Embed

Hang up the phone, and walk away
You told me

We all in that dog house

Confusin' the heart is, true
I know what the girl needs, faults
I'm good as an artist, true

Bring it in, Franky

What up Jim Jonson?
Drink another motherfuckin' beer
Slumerican shit

[Verse 1]
When I woke up this morning I was feeling like a brand new man
A brand new man?
Took a look outside and I saw that twenty one grand
What twenty one grand?
Oh yeah buddy, gold flakes - that's what's up
You ain't gotta tell me
What am I stupid?
Dipping them rims on a Harley Davidson
I'm spending spinning
What am I? loop it!
Watching days and nights just slowly pass me by
Two bottles and they already hollow
Jack Daniels left hook to the eye, boom
But I'm a one man army
[?] said no need to alarm me
Motherfuckers wanna pick my petals
Them you're better planting a seed and farming
Oops this party's starting
No need for parking and red carpeting
Cause that clogs up the arteries
Of all of these awkwardly
Hard to be reached people
That I have awesomely harvested into
This property properly title
Slumerican Idols
Idoling on the yellow beams
Drink until they fall into a dream
Motherfuckers all up in the trees
Looking for a package that I might leave, boy
That's power
35 and a half hours
Hours and hours and hours
Of mud in the trench
You shrimps better take a shower
Turn that bath water on
That's creek water roots
That's black water homes
I know Floyd but he ain’t Pink
That asshole's got a black motor home
Floyd gotta whole Caprice on chrome
Never gets cleaned cause he's always gone
Always on the run, always on the phone
Floyd is a boy to be left alone
Floyd is a boy to avoid that boy got a hectic cheque you can't afford
That doors unlocked cause Floyd got a toy
That will put holes in metal, boy
He's a heavy metal boy
On a another level, boy
Some say that he went down to the crossroads
And met the devil, boy
Bout that

But fill her up while I'm at this pump
Cause I'mma get 10 miles, you can bet your ass
Drop this funk, then I get a new dunk and park it slap on a neighbor's grass
Cause I leave a dent, leaves dead like beneath the tent
A seasoned wind, sprays it onto the trees that bend
And send themselves to a factory mill to paper thin
From towering life, to a page that's beneath this pen
Believe in men? God, Jesus Christ you should see the sin
We all part-take in this plagiaristic and evil spin on religion they give hindering growth
And even when you react, they react, with a bat and just beat it in
Ouch!
Fuck are we growing or blowing it?
All I can do is give you my 2 cents with a poem
Maybe that ain't enough, maybe my shows just ain't showing the people hints of liberation
They just roll it and smoke it, that's cool with me because
At least they get a CD buzz
That really does, make my job a little easier
So when you see me cuz, throw up a duce and leave it up
I still believe in love, Love Story now gitty up (up)
Back and forth across the floor, I crawl for more applause from your heart for my art
The props the more I rock the floor, till the tracks are wrapped
The more the pack of rats attack the rap
React, and lack, achieve the need to [?]
See the wave [?]
Jump the ship
A bunch of bitches switching fate, but this here is switch blade
Cut a fucking rug in such a public buzz, they fucking let me out
They fucking know I choked the bud and sucked the suds
[?] can't fuckin budge
But I'm a raven with razor wings, so lay the strings
So Wayne will lay these lazer beams, amazing eyes are watching now
I make 'em dream, I pave the way for lazy teens to make a scene
From north to pumpkin, use a pumpkin, fuckin make you drum with a thump-or-something
A thump-or-something
Look, you made a trampoline, ain't it jumpin'? (Bounce!)
And let me give some love to North Carolina, John Harrison, thanks for the idea buddy
If I come to Rocky Mount, I'll find ya
And we can run around in a box and talk about how fuckin' dope I am
I'm fuckin' with you..

Anyway fucking way I'm out, till I get another dope beat
Could be an hour, maybe a day
Probably drop another one next week, I'm bored

I'm gettin' drunk, Hammertime
What you say, punk? Hammertime
This one is yours, that one is mine
Raise it up, Hammertime
Hammertime, Hammertime, Hammertime, Hammertime
That one is yours, that one is mine

(Verse 1: Yelawolf)
Pull me over cause I'm fallin’ over, throwin' up
Runnin’ over rappers, drunk – “Hello, Mama - How was church?”
Another Sunday and I'm wakin’ up
Feelin’ like I ate a bowl of shit for dessert
For the first day of Christmas I want bud
Second day of Christmas I want Jack
Me and Santa Claus gonna crawl through the city in the Chevy
Throwin’ rocks at your front door, now
Shady Records, buddy, you don’t wanna war with that
You feelin’ real good cause I’m feelin’ laid back
But if I wanna run around the wanna circle with the chopper
So I can slow your roll, then I’ll do it in fact
And I’ll run around your all-black Maybach
With a can of white paint like I came from the top
When the CD drops if you wanna tell your mama
That you wanna come play like you came from the sty
I'm right on time, don't change the clock
With the prime of the rhyme - aim and cock
And the game's on lock, got the game in the box
Toys 'R U, we got "Us" on lock
Better push a mop, better find a job
Call the cops, find a dog
Cause if I make a call, then the people who care about you
Will never, ever, ever, ever find you at all
Aw naw! hell naw! I done up and done it
Football hundred, Crimson Tide, hand me a hundred
Yelawolf's raw, yeah he's done it
But I can't afford to lose this gold
It’d be like drivin’ a Ford to the show
I’d rather walk and get my Chevy towed
To the front door of the bar, I stroll!

Drunk, spittin’ like an infant on a baby’s bib
I could get hit by a freight train and live
But chicks, I’mma go hammer - I'mma go slam her
Try the Crown Royal with a little Goldschläger
Dude wanna go run us, mouth full of shit
I'mma bust him in the head with his SoCo bottle
He gon' need some cold water and a pack of ice

I wish a motherfucker the best of a lucka
Suckers can kiss my pickle, adjust your lip up and fucking pucker
I got pull like a trucker, specifically southern Louisville Slugger
Tucked on the Chevy rubber to bust your bubble
Hug your mother, don't lie to your brother
You know Yela's trouble, call the police, look at these bleeding knuckles
Alabama's elephant feet rumble, get pummelled and beat
Underneath the concrete like a street plumber
Give me the bucks from in the trees hundreds of leaves
Cover the Mossy Oak sleeves I got it, believe it momma
Corny motherfuckers we shuck em
And animals, we stuff em, a cannibal, he's bluffing nah
Woke up in the morning with a fucking pen and a pistol
I put one to the paper, I put one to my fears
Stuck up a shop with the pen then I shot up my notebook
I'm reading bullet holes, I wish you fucking would

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
I wish a motherfucker would tell me that I ain't hip hop
Bitch you ain't hip hop
I wish a motherfucker would tell me that my shit gonna flop
Bitch your shit shit gonna flop
I wish a motherfucker would tell me that I ain't hip hop

I got a white bitch who said she went to Pebblebrook
Graduated in '03 and love Yelawolf
I got more numbers than a yellow book
And I took more shots than Carmelo took
So I'm used to being an underdog
Send my goons to come assault every last one of y'all
No wonder all they broads take their pajamas off
Lick up under balls whenever I want to call
I'm a convict but I don't wear orange
I'm so raw, catch me in my rare form
I been fly, my momma gave birth to me on a plane
Nigga so I guess you could say I'm airborne
I'm running my city getting my mayor on
Stay on my grizzly, you know I bear arms

I wish a motherfucker would try to run up on me, I keep that clip cocked
I wish a motherfucker would tell that ain't kush that's in my ziploc

[Verse 3: Pill]
Au contraire mon frere one pure pain giver
Don't ingest this, it might cause corrosion of the liver
Yeah toxic, drop-kick opponents on arrival
This ain't hip hop, this is the manual to survival
Take notes fake folks, imitators and lovers
Of true life G's risen up from the gutter
I'm on somethin', different from the rest of you rappers
And that's real shit, Pill spits exactly what happened
This is chemistry?
Please explain the vivid scenes of what occurred on streets
And I doubt if you know what it really means
Cultural differences divide us and our nemesis
When music is the food for living I think we all forgetting this
Born into poverty, hard torn obviously
Dad gone so we trying to figure out how to eat
Older brother hustling, momma working overtime
Now I'm standing in the kitchen whipping baking soda time
[Chorus: Yelawolf]
I wish a motherfucker would tell me this ain't straight drop yams fresh out the pot
I wish a motherfucker would tell me this ain't a trap spot serving it to a block
I wish a motherfucker would tell me this ain't a yam shop, come and order your rocks

But you’d rather see me stuck in the shade

So thank you I must bless you
It's unbelievable you could rescue

Just so I can hear 'em say:

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
I started my journey down in Alabama
Then my mama threw me in a swamp when I was five out in Louisiana
She told me to take my state of ware with me
Then we moved to Oklahoma with her boyfriend from Mississippi
Her boyfriend was in the country music industry
So we hopped on a tour bus from Texas and went to Tennessee
Met a dude from New York at a rest stop in Arkansas he said, (Goddamn!)
"You really do say howdy ya'll!" (Howdy ya'll)
I'm a nomad, yeah, kinda sorta
I got stranded in Georgia
But I was headed to Florida
I hitchhiked the rest of the way down to Palm Beach
And I one-nighted a girl with black hair from Hawaii
I don't know how I landed in Indiana
But I got this Crimson Tide banner
And I ain't gonna stop until

I bucked to Ohio
And swam through Kentucky
Grabbed a bottle of Jim Beam
Got drunk and was feeling lucky
Met a girl who met a boy from Illinois who just dropped him
Because he moved to Wisconsin
Well, I took her over to Minnesota
I tip-toed out of the room with her purse and now, Iowa!
I hurried to Missouri, from there I went to Kansas
Rode a twister to Nebraska, drove the Dakotas with Candice
Stopped in Montana to refill my bottle

I was headed for Utah so he offered me a sack of potatoes
I told him thank you for the ride up the road but I'm fine though
There's plenty of those up in Idaho
But Arizona's got some beautiful women though like (Goddamn!)
She's fine but I gotta go!
30 pack, now I'm Oregon
I hit a couple of divin' boys when I stumbled into Washington

Rolling dope as a summer time sport
Hold up! I'm on the hill
If you shake it up, better let it chill
Creekwater still spills

Pedal the big wheel
Kind of a big deal
Black like a wet seal
White like an x pill
Fight like a trailer park, boy!
Raw best still
Look for the best deal
Look no further
I put habaneros on your hamburger
I pull bow and arrows out on you
You would think it's murder
Leave me with your bitch in a mini-skirt
And I might serve her
Park on the curber
Treating the beat like a pervert
Fuck it, eat it, beat it, see us
Like a cleavage on a
Scenic route through my city
I bleed it, believe it I breath it harder
Mama! Pick up hella weed and
Hello papa tis' the season
Mine is coming, his is leaving
Sally ain't looking good, what's she breathing?

I got that shit is selling homie? habit
To avenues cuts alleyways dirt roads paddle boats paddle through lake? Through a fork!
Still got a duffel bag in the trunk
If I'm going out, I'm going out with a honk
Who, what, when, where? Buddy I'll be there
Watch my Paw Paw pull a sawed off out of the rocking chair (POP)
I don't know how to stop it, stop where?
Here? Alright, cool.. I guess I'll leave it there, dude

Now pick it up

Moonshine in the noon time, give me the hiccitup
Stick it up. Baby, you just ain't thick enough
Put a brick in your butt, let's thicken it up
That's how we live it up
That's movin' weight, call it and pick the kitties up
Sit in this pick up truck. Let's go hit the city, slut
808 black and give you many nuts
Vibrate on a highway. That's Catfish Billy up
Go pop a pilly I'm a toon like I'm mitted up

Gitty up, gitty up. Horsey I'll rock your pretty up
Idiot shouldn'ta took a loan from a loan shark
You owe me money as soon as the fucking song starts
I am a thrown dart, don't walk in front of it
Don't be a football to the boot that I punt it with, nice kick. Field goal!
I spit ice picks.Cypress Hill. bro
That's some tight shit, but that's what I'm here for
We ain't going out like thatEmbed

Talking to myself is like talking to god himself
Minus the god and religion
Slumerican has become an assistant to my vision
It’s like I unlocked a prison
My warriors spirit, tore into the recording, hear it
Put me at your court appearance
Yela made me pop a trunk
Yela made me pop a chump
Didn’t even know I did it
Don’t pull a 2Pac on me homie
Music ain’t the life you wanna imitate besides
My life ain’t even Kosher
If you seen that toaster sitting there
Bathtub side, you would crack up - why?
I’mma hoot owl like, wow like I’mma stoop yeah
Really you, yeah
Me in school with a bowl cut and a missing tooth
Listen to me ain’t a movie made, you can name
That can fit the shade, of the life I gave
Ain’t no fucking way, you can chuck grenades
All day I’m a mile away, sitting in the shade
Sippin’ Santa Fe
Ain’t nobody even in my panoramic
Listen that I’m all rap and playing in the sandbox
When this camera hits
They goin’ have to fucking plan a day with
A scientist to see where Yela’s brain is
I’m a language of all the ancients
I’m a flame with that 'here it aim - hits'
Probably the way the earth
Wobbles on the tilt, in the atmosphere
That the bottle in my hand puts me in earth
On the wobble in the same year, yeah, that’s a little deep huh
I’m a fucking mermaid, huh
Below the belt
Goddamn you, you might need a nurse aid, huh
You car alarm chirps, huh
Every time you see these tattoos, huh
Your car alarm works, huh
Don’t worry I don’t drive Ford’s dude
Now I prefer to keep it legal in the freedom
Is to speak In which I speak to people
I conceive a thought
And breathe at least a bit of inspiration
For the geeks and evil people
These fucking MC’s are weasel
Through the cracks I leave you on your back
Quicker than Knievel would jump on a Harley and jump over cars
He set on fire cross the river nile in Egypt
You fucking with a mastermind of rap design
You stuck up in an elevator with the blind
Dumb and deaf serial killer with the rhyme
Ain’t no where to go trying’ to push a baton
Con artists shocked , cause I shock a con/Chaka Khan
Fuck a time watch, me I’m a dime, keep in line cops
Be up in mine, I’mma down all these fucking 9’s
I’m a 10 plus 10, I’m a 5 quarterback sneak
Take 25 cent’s in a two-piece of my mind
While stick a new beat to the side
Lean to the ride, jeans to the boots
Clean as a ride, clean, but I doubt
Me being a 5 to go get high and I got a 5 see
Got a pound for the worse
Got a mouth for the verse
Got to keep that fucking sound for the howling Wolf to serve
Put a brand new rapper on serve
Put a brand new Chevy in there
Wrap 'em both on the curve, word
Better get a hold of life
Better get a hold on mama like tonight's supper
Y'all in trouble like Tucker was
When he saw that fight up the street, squeaking - bitch
Where's the white tupperware/where-
Would I hide your weed?
Give me that hydro weed, in the hotel tour
Where will the bible be? Right with the pile of weed
Gun to the fuckin' head
Why would Micheal be running' for the life of me?
Cause I'm a fuckin' C, R-I-M-I-N-A-L, bye bye, Raphael
Donatello hello put one through your shell
Liberate your mind, I'll put one through your bell
I'mma act a donkey, I'mma pin-a-tail
With the fuckin' pen, I will pen-a-tale
Straight from the back of the mind of an intellectual
Spit one of my poems, and throw 'em into hell
Fuck an infidel, no Huckleberry Finn, no fucking fairytale
No church to marry in, I married it myself
The heard I [?] in is scary in itself
The purgatory of recording
I'm a rapper sorting through my story
Hoarding words and ordering a burger
While this mic is murder death
R.I.P this booth
Better get a suit and tie
Man, this burger's great!
See I'm like a sail sitting in the wind
I'm multitasking
Whoop that ass
An octopus would drop and do some push ups
If he saw these military arms
You thought I was gone
But...

CreekWater
18 ContributorsCreekWater Lyrics[Intro]
Allright allright
(Bu-bum-bum-bum-bum)
Yeah
The Creekwater
The Creekwater
What's that you say?
Well, it's like this:
From the ocean to the river
River to the streams
Streams to the creek
The creek is where it all meets homeboy
You know what I'm saying

[Verse 1]
Okay, let's get it started folks
My name is Yelawolf
I'm a southern head
Fed white bread
Been caught where they go to
All of my people they B-Boys
Some of them B's are bad
Some of them got that heart to sell with paint cans in their bag
Mr. clever on the wheels with plenty moves for your ass too
And if it's war between the crews
But he hang it up, fell through
Time and time again I'm like a clock with this here pen
And it's like tick-tock tick-tock
Just give me the verse laid down
I'm from where the rednecks get better jobs and bigger checks
Momma working 9 to 5 slaveshifts
Coming home late the microwaveable plates kept my stomach full
I thank to lord that was a gift
My world is surrounded by hypocrites and demons in body suits
Tryna recruit me as an advocate
Rapping and talking 'bout fame and loot
Now, how the hell did you think I wouldn't smell that poo under your shoe boy?
You might also like[Chorus 1]
Don't try to play me for weak or underestimate me
What you see ain't exactly what you expect it to be
I'm from the Creekwater, been raised what I thought
I leave a trail of mud behind me everywhere that I walk
Blame it on the streets, blame it on the freaks
Blame it on my momma 'cause she threw me in the creek
I'm from the Creekwater, been raised what I thought
I leave a trail of mud behind me everywhere that I walk

[Verse 2]
"Good one Wolf, another hot hook", says the engineer
"That's one take, taking it for real, let's be out, you want a beer?"
Nah, I better get back to the cabin
Mama this all I can do to get high?
"No marihuana inside of my ride please
But I do sell them trees"
Now how about a second a spectacular have it
I got back in this cabbage
I don't mean that green you feeding your family
But I got that if you're asking
A lot of these kids are packing nowadays
In the mark where I stay
Living for the moment
Rap it outside in the hallways
Let it prepare your mind and body
For the common of the trailers and the porta pottys
I'm just being real
No one american people I used to apologize
Hold my steel
I swore that rhymes and lines reveal
We'll be taking serious folks
And when I'm done, how do you feel?
Good, I'm glad, nice to hear it
Glad you got a bite
I hope you keep full but still keep a appetite
You just ate some jumbalaya
Georgia Alabama Tennessee
And if somebody ask you why you went
Tell 'em you went to the creek
[Chorus 2]
Don't try to play me for weak or underestimate me
What you see ain't exactly what you expect it to be
I'm from the Creekwater, been raised what I thought
I leave a trail of mud behind me everywhere that I walk
Blame it on the streets, blame it on the freaks
Blame it on my momma 'cause she threw me in the creek
I'm from the Creekwater, been raised what I thought
I leave a trail of mud behind me everywhere that I walk

[Verse 3]
You might can tell where I was raised when you see my Caprice
Hubcaps clean, Fila's and Reebok's under my feet
I'm from the creek
If 808's ain't dropping in my seat
Then you better be saying something that can move me
See we don't play a shit around here because you got game
And who don't rap, you are not special because you got fame
Backpacking MC's
Lacking this Creekwater the greed you stuck too
These briar patches you get drug through
Watch out for the crawdads when you on a bank
They skim and they watch hard
If you drop hard on in front of the bank
No where to escape
The flood waters of the south that run through your home dude
If you live in the creek like I do
In New Orleans they got them gators that will bite you
In Alabama we got moccasins that strike you
Sometimes they wear white hoods, even the cops do
The truth in my rhymes, quote me when you ride through
I know I'm from the creek
[Chorus 3]
Don't try to play me for weak or underestimate me
What you see ain't exactly what you expect it to be
I'm from the Creekwater, been raised what I thought
I leave a trail of mud behind me everywhere that I walk
Blame it on the streets, blame it on the freaks
Blame it on my momma 'cause she threw me in the creek
I'm from the Creekwater, been raised what I thought
I leave a trail of mud behind me everywhere that I walkEmbed

Get a grip, get ammo

A hick with a hit's, a trick with this Kango
Anywhere can't do anything and I chewed, I sticked to gets me this candle
Lid and descry, but this candle's been lit, by this vandal
Eminem thinks this kid's sick and dismantled
From the triage in Atlanta
To the sea in Alabama
For me to be another channel
For you, to serve things scrambled
Top form and alive, I bust so much fire that my dick's a Roman candle
Sip so up high, sip so much Jack that my last name should have been Daniels

Light as a Feather

Long as I got my pistol, I'ma take 'em with me when I go
Bullet for every woe, trigger for every throat
Put me in the ground but I'll be back around
Walkin' on dry leaves and won't make a sound
Ayo, Billy got bars, don't gotta look to find 'em
Build up my bars like a zoo animal and live behind 'em
Vibration couldn't stop a UFO mid-flight
When I'm lurkin' pitch black in the woods at midnight, midnight

[Chorus]
Light as a feather, stiff as a board
I'm feelin' better, better than before
I'm layin' level, I'm layin' level, ten feet off the floor
When I'm light as a feather, stiff as a board

[Verse 2]
I just bought a sack of marijuana and hit the sauna
I'ma boujee now, I ain't Ubеrin' in no fuckin' Honda
Wouldn't take the Subaru to chase a kangaroo
If I needеd a jump from a mini-van for my soccer momma
I ain't takin' orders from prima donnas unless she's orderin' McDonald's
I can afford the dollar, get what you wanna
She poured me whiskey and said "Man, I'm honored"
I threw the glass, bitch, I need ice cubes like anaconda
Left the gas station with a tall tea and hot nachos
A glass pipe, a gold rope, and a Choco Taco
Trailer park Hollywood bitch, low-fashion hot model
5150 gets drippin' like shook popped bottles

[Verse 3]
Still ride slow like Paul and Kanye
I had to hire a mover just to pick up the pace
Drinkin' so much Creek Water I locked my keys in a safe
I had to go buy the scooter just to make it to stage
Got the people all actin' stupid and loopy, what can I say?
What I thought was a can of worms was a barrel of snakes
Then bust that shit open then, let's get it for God's sakes
Hear mama come yellin' "Beat 'em to death with a yard rake!"
Now picture me fishin' under a tarp on a dark day
Grease poppin' and sizzlin', a filet, table, and a sharp blade
Now picture these haters swimmin' around music I create
It's not a matter of if, it's which one will take the bait
So bite, fuck a bite, it's yours
You chasin' the beef? You want some ground Chuck Norris?
You partial to martial arts? Well chop it up for us
While I hippity-hop on this mainstream hit chorus like

Over Again
10 ContributorsOver Again Lyrics[Intro]
Why do I feel like killing myself with this love?
Why do I drown my sorrow inside of the clubs?
Why must I do these things to hurt just to feel alive?
Maybe my icons are desperate, may be why
I'm not afraid to tell God I'm a troubled soul
Trouble is how I ride all this shit, so I guess he knows
I made a living off of gravediggin'
I'm a stone setter with no diamonds just one in the rough
So put two in my cup, I'm downtrodden, ridin'

[Chorus]
I can't see you again
Too many drinks again
(Over again, over again, over again, over again)
Too many drinks again
(Over again, over again, over again, over again)
I can't see you again
(Over again, over again, over again)
Too many drinks

[Verse]
Scarred from what the knife brung, beauty cuts deep
Especially tonight, yeah, especially
I walked the broken line 'til I reach a deep trench
Swim across the risky river, no defense
Dark days, baby boy, no lights on
I braved the alleyways, cold grip, python
Braced myself for impact with the beer back
A crooked reflection, even though the mirror's flat
Molotov cocktail to my ether, hot flash
Nightmare, sweat stains in the sheets, yeah, it's a dream state
Hell's fire is a deep lake and the devil is a cheap date
He's a cheap date, cheap date, cheap date

Chocolate chip ecstasy
'Bout to sell a couple to a redhead, yeah
I'ma meet him in the back in the Burger King
Said he was an Eminem fan
So I gave him an autograph and said vicariously
And I never use that sparingly
American, please, take two on me
Get a pair of new chucks, put 'em in the back seat
Right next to the other fifty pair
I put 'еm on now, ready, I'm fresh as fuck
I change clothеs like I never had shit to wear
Like I never had a new whip to clean
Scrubbin' white walls, I can get tipped, yeah
Like I've never had a bucket seat to lean
Grippin' woodgrain 'til I catch a blister, yeah
I'ma head over to the bar, reach in the toolbox
Throw a monkey wrench and catch a ratchet
Head up into the car, reach in the glove box
Pop the trunk and go jack a rabbit
In the mood to be rude, crude and trashy

Hittin' for the low like a basement, new floors

Looking for Alien Love

S'matterwitchu?
S'matter

[Verse 1]
Gather ‘round people
From my distant world
Across Etowah County I reach
Into your zone
Excuse me for cuttin’ in line
I am awful sorry for intruding on your space
But I feel I am rather blessed in this issue
Which you happen to be involved with
Love is only relevant if you understand the target
Any questions?

[Hook]
I’m on my own, I’m a single man
Looking for a heart that I can understand
I’m looking for my love

[Verse 2]
Well, love is a prism
Two lights thrown, and um
Receivin’ it’s hard to comprehend the human rhythms
Ya know?
Well I guess it’s kinda like our satellites
One floats around until the signal reaches a receiver
One floats around until the love reaches a believer
Get it?
You might also like[Hook]
I never really found out how hard it might be
Everybody before me couldn’t answer me
So I’m still looking for my love

[Break]
It’s kinda like drawing sticks
But if you gamble with this, don’t gamble counterfeit, come real

[Hook-Continued]
I’m on my own, I’m a single man
Looking for a heart that I can understand
I’m looking for my love
I’m looking for my love
Looking for my love

[Verse 3]
Catfish Billy, and I hail from the bottom
I treat music like fat people treat shoes when they’re joggin’
Make souls bounce off the concrete
Give people a new reason to believe in these poetic zombies
I don’t support the dead unless they’re grateful
“Soul food” is a metaphor, Yelar says, “Get you a plate full”
A lot of rappers are servin’ birds
They’re trippin’
I give you a CD, you eat free
That’s a real whole chicken
Don’t be so God damn easily impressed
In ’93 you had to rap, what the fuck ever happened to that?
They pick up the game, and can’t drop one the net
KP said it was a pickup game, just be properly dressed (Ha)
It’s like they heard the joke and took him serious though
And a bunch of people pulled up hungry with a blinged out cereal bowl
But ya can’t get Corn Flakes if your music is born fake
So, Cheerio chap, here’s some Lucky Charms, good luck
Fuck
Now that there was unnecessary
But when you’ve got words like these, then a word like “fuck” it just get’s buried
Unlike them who meet fuck and go get married
Have a bunch of fucking babies, before the fucking wedding
The MC to be didn’t go to dress rehearsal
Now you back in a pickup game, Fucc Boi, in a fucking commercial
Now hold the catfish again
I swam 8 miles on the bottom of Lake Michigan
To reel me into the mainstream made ‘em nervous
So I rolled to the motherfucking kick drums under the surface
You’re sobbin’ under water ya’ll
And I leak so much ink I leave Mead books waterlogged
I know some want my art to pause
‘Cause I play with rap music like driftwood in an otter’s paw
Now that’s some country shit to say bro
Not as country as working construction and doing a show in the same clothes
Yellow, they know, they know
I’m on top of this kindergarten shit building fine art outta Play-Doh
Tell me have you even in your long-legged life seen an alien catfish?
Have you even been slapped by a one eyed one horned purple people eater?
Well back the water like a beaver
Then let it go like Noah
Better learn to swim without floaties
Better learn to live without quotas
Got a carry-on bag from the outer limits
Travelin’ a billion miles a minute
Light speed on the mic
I become a livin’ alien in the Alabama sun, sun...sun-shine
[Outro]
Come see me again
Or… shall I come, see you
I’ll come visit
With my buddy, Scraggly
Y'know, any ol' time
Catfish Billy
Lookin' for my love
Can’t seem to find it
My love for…
Wack shit that is
Can’t find no love for it
Can’t find no love for it
And I’m back at it again!1Embed

I took a shot of Jack D and I threw the dice on the board like it was a Christmas game

And a wish list for the business in the back of the whip with this mystic mane

Baby don't shoot me down
No I don't know shit about you but you got a pretty face and the booty's round
Don't get moody now, show me the sound, I am new to town
Got a tank a gas so let's cruise around, wanna spank that ass and get boomin' loud
Ha did I say that, never mind baby girl just lay back
Not in the way back of a Maybach but the suede that's made where the queens lay at
So you ride around in a Chrysler, but my Chevy fits the best
Well get rid of that Oldsmobile, Oldsmobile's Cutlass

Chainsaw Jenkins back at it again
With the non-stop rock-n-roll
This is 103.39
And we are trappin' a sack in the back of the Conoco live though
Hit us up 256-442-9981
For the shittiest weed you can smoke

[Verse 1]
Just cranked on the boys drinkin' whiskey
No shirt and my bolo tie swingin'
Bible belt in my Levi skinnies
And my permanent gold tooth grinnin'
Pop the top on the ice cold Bud
Seeds poppin' on that Mexican bud
Tellin' all the kids don't use drugs
Boy you ain't no fire cracker, you a dud
EBT fresh meat on the grill
Government cheese, government milk
Truck broke down, need to get built
Baby's lingerie Walmart silk
Four tens, dip, kеys and a beeper
Stuck 'em right between thе eyes, he's a bleeder
Yeah, I cut him low like my weed eater
'Cause he caught my feedback like a speaker

Get that old Chevy on the highway
Let the smoke bellow out the side
Shells in the cigarette ash tray
But that ain't no blank shell, no lie
Bandanna over my noggin
Mama used to call me skillet head
By nine o'clock PM I'll be wobblin'
And I'ma make her go and count that bread
Black Starter jacket and stock Nike
Watch pocket where I keep that drank
Try to stick me for a nickel got aim
No lead he was drawin', no blank
In the south where the people move slow
Give you springtime bounce in the snow
Got the stash spot scout on the low
And we gon' hide the duffle in the corn rows

Kerosene flame in the winter time
Chili bowl still got shotgun pellets
Bitch, you know the devil ain't no friend of mine
But if you're lookin' for a cheap thrill, I'll sell it
Fake nugget, crucifix broke layin' in the grease pile
Mountain Dew cans been sittin' for a deep while
Brillo pad, burnt glass pipe for the five spot
Catch a quick high then drop by the pawn shop
Old timer with the crooked face looked shocked
Never seen a white boy around this block
But it's work, work, work, 360 'round the clock
So I pulled the box in and I let the trunk pop
Supposed to be scared but I still ain't
Supposed to be sober but I still drink
Hard to hit a movin' target but I still aim

Ain't nobody like Billy, nobody, boy, Billy got the big bass drop, come on

Got a blue windbreaker on Walmart
Deep pockets, buddy, I'ma need a tall cart
Fishnet on a leg lampshade
Turn the lights on, now that's what I call art
From the gutter like the bottom of a long fall
Move to my own beat like the song's off
Gettin' busy like I'm dialin' up the wrong call
Heels on the damn toes for the long walks
Story like I'm Rod Corey 'cause I get stoned
Got 'em drawin' up a blank as I get gone
Catfish Billy, yeah, I got a sick clone
And he's in the laboratory with a brick phone

Must've weighed about at least two hundred fifty pounds
Laid up on the ground down with her ass out
Never met her, but we call her Big Crack House

Single wide with the matchstick dry eye
Throw the flame like a propane lit up
Back to work on time, never one to win
Got the 808 knock like I'm comin' in
Blowin' through the notebook like a summer wind
Pullin' up with Ounce Zilla and my cousin Nin

[Verse 1]
Pink jelly slippers, Whoopi Goldberg yellow Reebok pumps
Polka dotted button ups
Swatch watch, doubled up
And the pinky ring in force
Sticky purple reefer buds
Sick as fuck she got the bug
People bringin' in the guap
Mama bringin' in the drugs
Stackin' up that folded money
You know daddy never does
Countin' all that profit up
Heavy tipper at the club
Treat the hustle like a cripple if a cripple need a crutch
Then she walk across the street
Take your keys and leave you stuck
Throw that rouge up on her lips
Flip the mirror in the whip
Barber razor blade inside that Gucci wallet off the hip
Got the stick up off the boat in case you need that brick shipped
Got the LSD on paper case you bitches wanna trip

Took the suitcase to the boss and did that shit without a Glock
Gotta go collect the stock
Got a goon that's on the watch
Got a goon on paper, too
Yeah, that goon is punchin' clocks
Powder on the kitchen table, powder on the counter top
She's a natural born killer
Make a killin' 'til ya drop
Dump that duffle bag in one
If they chase, they never stop
Leave your product home with mama
And bring mama back the pot
Never sleep, she never dream
Never need no weddin' ring
All she do is shop and hustle so she never cook and clean
She's an 80s baby
MTV with Bowie on the screen
And her bangs are always perfect like her favorite magazine

Still got plastic on the couch
Got that accent in the south
Tell me what you talkin' 'bout
Ain't no pool table in sight
But that 8-ball is in route
Corner pocket of her leopard coat said this one’s on the house
Drop a name, she never does, drop a dime, I highly doubt
Too much ridin' on the family, holdin' down the local drought
Cadillac is all original, you see her backin' out
Brown paint, brown guts, so she call it "Black & Mild"
If you're lucky with your plug, well then you'll maybe get a call
Keep that beeper on vibrate and don't tell nobody at all
Yeah, that circle super tight, so be careful how you talk
Pulled that pistol out her purse and put that pistol down your drawers

I went through the fire
Flames made me pure
Feds were fishing for a confession
I ain't bite the lore
Took a tour of the country
In a federal van
The light overcame the darkness
In the devilish land
Knowing that the change must come but Sam Cook seems
15 minute phone calls press 5 when it rings
Locked doors open my mind, find peace
The animal I became is tamed a kind beast
Attending birthdays through pictures
Tears on concrete
Refusing to lose
Over the years of defeat
Now I speak the truth
They try to quiet my choir
Been to hell and back
This is trial by fire
Desire to find the higher power
In the hour of despair
Cutting out the stitches
Yes there's bridges to repair
Holding on to whats left
Trying to stay right
After the chaos of the night
Comes daylightYou might also likeEmbed

Then a put the Chevy in cruise, took everybody to etiquette school
Listen up baby they said "you don't have a clue", it ain't fuck you, it's..FUCK YOU!!

You don't ride a bike in sandals do you (no)

[Verse]
I am still that motherfucker
Ain't nothing new to this
Been that country cousin way before I even knew K.R.I.T
Seven hundred dollar glass of whiskey and I shoots it
Using my gold teeth to take an olive off a toothpick
Throw the bitch back in an empty bottle then I stepped out the Silverado
Light a cigarette up and then hobble off into the alleyway covered in smoke like the Legend of Sleepy Hallow
Colder than a December breeze in Chicago, rolling up my sleeves in this one and a lot of them out here working hard but that ain’t my problem, fuck ‘em all because of all that shit was borrowed
Got a bucket to piss in I’m good on this end, no college tuition
On a whole other mission, I’m headed to Memphis to fuck with the remix
Keep Bumping Three 6, pull up at the big pen and create a helix
Be the breath of a phoenix
Been dripping, been leaking, juice, bitch, you see ‘em drinking
Look at all my puppy dogs, daddy left you in the kitchen
Now you fucking going off cooking up a new rendition
Country rappers on my balls look at all the redneckism
Should’ve popped some Adderall, I wasn’t paying attention
That ADD’s like SATs I never took nothing for it
Dazed and confused major league dude, I never took nothing for it
I was just bored, I was just stuck in my trailer walking back and forth
Became a rapper just so I could sing and lose every fan that I had before
Everyday all day, didn’t have that tattoo
Around about ’08 back when I wore Phat shoes
No Balenciaga’s I was hoarding Jordan’s with a corduroy hat fedora in Florida
Forget about the old me kinda sorta
Put on a pair of boots and I jump the border
But what’s a border to a native quarter but a way to make Trump create an order
I’m a rebel bitch I don’t wait at the shore for a wave to crash I go and make the water
Transport a serpent earth I’m never nervous, you can’t evolve living on the surface
You can’t take me from my purpose, that’s like taking 50 from Curtis
So hop in the next lane, yeah just I hop in the next lane
But I got the whole fucking highway, run over you like a sept tank
Trying to catch up in your Reeboks, you better watch where you’re stepping
I’ll shit on your Champion sweatsuit,  cos me and Hip-Hop got a wedding
But I’m musically polygamous idiot rock and roll we did the same thing
Yeah I’m 'bout the Slum South, striped suits and the chain gangs
See if Johnny Cash and Jim Morrison became B-boys with Eminem and Pink Floyd
Then forged a group with Hank III of course then Slumerican would be the emporium

[Verse 1: YelaWolf]
Catfish... Yeah
Mixin' up the medicine
Tripping on the mescaline
Moonshine in the bottle
Got the rooms running like peppermints
Spinning like a ceiling fan
Hotter than I've ever been
If you wanna chop it up
You need a propeller, man
Cellophane, sell a gram
Don't sell me the weather, man
If you wanna make it rain
'Make It Rain' a better jam
Y'all weaker than baby's hands
Faker than a rent-a-van
Take it back, make a track
Then give a pen to Yela, man
An' I'll stomp on that beat
Like its a fight that I'm just jumping in
The south is getting crunk again
In-and-out like I'm punching in
Bitch better go take lunch again
I'm working with a bomb of confidence
Politicking  and flipping the system
Using my wrist and mixin'...

Still making money off the white girl - Fergie
I ain't a new boy so they know they can't jerk me
No limit how I get it, call me Percy
Miller, I'mma killer, no mercy
And I'm so dope you'd think Frank Lucas served me
So hot fire couldn't burn me
Bitches wanna nurse me
Take her out and trick around
I take her home and dick her down
And send her back to you

Y'all niggas remember me

And if her body crazy, I'mma take her to the nuthouse (Pow)
You lames ain't interesting

You niggas full of sugar and I came with the insulin
Whatever's your addiction

I get it how I'm living and I'm loving every minute
You got that shit that just came out, that new-new

I'm so intriguing, your girl so deceiving
I'm so exciting and she's so conniving

If you want me baby
I'll take care of you
You'll probably do me wrong now
Yeah it's sad but true
You've got your problems baby
I got my problems too
I won't judge, I don't care, I won't tell
What have they done to you

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Hold up wait a minute was that Colorado
'Cause she was ice cold chocolate with a powdered nose
Kinda like an eskimo pie in the white snow
I was only 18 though I had a thing
For a woman who enjoyed a good time with a dime
Never thought I’d run into a dime with the mind
Of a fiend and the shape of an artist’s line
Fine like peach fuzz she was
Glass-like frail I could tell
Ain’t that a shame proclaimed her mommy
Went from fresh meat to sliced salami
For a piece of bread she would spread
And mayonnaise a lot of people in that line
But she was already stuck in my heart
She kissed my head and blew my mind

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
A summer breeze in the crease of the window
Whistled in the one bedroom we shared
On the beachfront ghetto of dogtown
In front of box fans on high we stared
Into the wave breaks on sand
And imagined if a duffle bag of dope would just wash up clean
And we would crawl in like Boston George
'Cause Boston George could afford nice things
She laid wet from the sex sweat broke
And on the tin tray my seeds did grow
I sparked it
Baby if you had a magic carpet
Where would you proceed to go
She said I'm writing a book about me
And it's called "Run Away From Fear"
But since I hit the chapter about cocaine
I've been stuck on this page here

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
You ain't gotta die a widow
You might be heartbroke but you are not heartless
You made love to many people with bows and cars and new clothes 'cause you were the hot target
But only fools lie in a bullseye
You gave me a loose knot to climb and pull by
And I'm illusioned and used, why
I see the good in you, I feel I can prove why
We can sit inside this car
Lay white lines on the dashboard top
From the peak of a Hollywood hill
And dance to the sound of vintage rock
And when this old radio stops
We can write a song about anything you wanna about
What you wanna write about, fill that page
And we can write a chapter on yesterday
[Hook: Yelawolf]
If you want me baby
I'll take care of you
You'll probably do me wrong now
Yeah it's sad but true
You've got your problems baby

All Aboard
12 ContributorsAll Aboard Lyrics[Bridge]
Some people run from some people who wanna save 'em
Some people got guns, some people you wanna stay from
When the train rode in, why did all my friends turn around and say "goodbye"?
'Cause some people don't know they standing at the station...

[Verse 1]
Come on in, I'm making room for you, her, and him
Also for those, we, them, and they, three course meal on a silver tray
Lay in the lab of luxury, watch fine wine incubate
With the white cloth laid over the side, one for the hands, one for the face
One for the luck, one for the pride, one way ride out of yesterday
You can lay down or you can lie, just don't lie straight to my face
Got a place you can keep the coats at, and a safe for the jewelry
Got a place to develop the Kodak to keep up with the memories
And the picture frame from the past, you can hang it up on the wall
And you can watch your past from the back of the train as you leave it all
You might seen a few trains come by, but this train you never saw before
You better make up your mind the conductor is saying “all aboard!"

[Verse 2]
It's such a view, but it's reserved for such the few
Such the luck for such as who, but who is me and who is you
You got a free ride that you can't refuse, choice in the form of a new caboose
A chance in the shape of a railroad track, hop inside make the move
Break from the old and create the new
Leave all the fake and replace the true
Pack the bags, leave the name tag, claim the ticket God paid for you
Drapes of linen, navy blue, but they're not made to block the light
The light from the sun will see us through
And you can sleep well in the peace of night
'Cause you might not see it twice in the small town where you live
So believe in the right to life 'cause the the left to death is where you steer
You might seen a few trains come by but this train you never saw before
You better make up your mind the conductor is saying “all aboard!"

Catfish Billy!
MWA Bitch!
Low-fashion slum
Mr. Don Corleone!

[Verse]
One drop or a knot from this boss
You might get rocked with the fist or shot what you stuck in the cross
Hairs of a semi-au-to through your nach-o
See I gave a fuck once, now I do not though
Hello, hello, I, lit up like a yellow light
Like a young Jesco White, on a mellow-yellow high
Chip a tooth when that pebble flies, back at that Chevy wheel
Seen the world through the Devil's eyes, he dared me to make a deal
I decline, king of mine, that's a waste of time
Give me a break, spit on the snake, let 'em taste the lines
Cowboy boots scaled like a plate of dimes
Black suede pressed dress to create a grime
You let your fangs hang, haters can't do a dang thang
But complain, comment and shame, claiming to gang-bang
That same bitch that you double-tapping to bang came
To my show like Su-Sussudio and show me brain games
See visionaries ain't got no problem with execution
I just wake up like a prophet and hop up and fucking do it
No logical explanation on how I drop my music
I just find a socket, plug it in pocket and lock into it
Oh, what a wonderful feeling
Gotta take a minute and do some breathing
Ain't take a day off work since I went and took Cleveland, looking for a reason
Looking for a tie, looking for a suit
That Rock and Roll Hall-of-Fame is due
Overdue, but the road is loosie
When you gonna invade it's no-one's clue
No one knows, where it goes
Where you've been or what to do
But that's me in a nutshell bro
Going nuts, deja-vu
Oh what a dream, row your boats
Sow your oats, all with the beans
Ain't no gas, kid lets rock, buy with the bot, not with the lean
In my coat when I fucking pop, like a mushroom in the morning gleam
After a rain, in the spring, Michael Wayne, yeah-that's me
Got it locked, that is key
Got it hot in the C-
O-U-N-T-R-Y, Catfish in your sore eyes
If you want that four-five, come on in the doors-wide
So deep that said your-tribe, welcome to the north side
Look up in the back, that Heisenberg hat, pork pie
Stick you to that Get Buck, Three-6  is our war cry
Kids are playing Fortnite, I was playing short-sight
Didn't see tomorrow, I just wanted one more bite
So I started stealing, chopping parts under the porch light
I just wanted better than what Mamma could afford, why?
Cause I am a son of a bitch! Hard as you ever saw
Shut up and  duck or get hit, with this here pepper y'all
Huddle-up with your fucked clique, and hit some methanol
Suck a dick, sucka suck shit, all through an effin' straw
Naw he didn't-oh, yes the fuck I did!
Now take these words, stay woke, and tattoo both eye lids
Y'all bitches sleeping on me? I need my own Hilton
I come with cots for you bots, go take a nap in the den
While I master a plan with the mastering Mathers again
Slum-Shady, I'm plumb-crazy and laughing again
But when that trash in the atmosphere like a ravenous wind
When I pass in that black Cadillac, with Travis and em'
Yeah, and its so much fun going at it again
I just might need to sing a bit, go get some practice and then
So let me clear my throat, let me see if I hear the notes
I hear the notes, now look in your black mirror and strike a pose

Sobriety Sucks
12 ContributorsSobriety Sucks Lyrics[Intro]
I don’t know what the fuck I did with my wallet, where’d it go?
Hey mate can I get it into the phone to call my people ‘cuz I lost my phone too?
I don’t think that’s him, what you ask for?
One two three fuck it up
One two three fuck it up
One two three fuck it up
One two three let’s go

[Hook]
Eeey! I’m the life of the party
Eeey! Look what I just started
Eeey! How you doin’, what’s up?
Now everybody raise your cups and sing
Sobriety sucks, sobriety sucks
Sobriety sucks, sobriety sucks
Sobriety sucks, sobriety sucks
Man I never wanna grow up
Sobriety sucks

[Verse 1]
People think it so cool to see me drink all this Jack
Man I don’t know what I started, sometimes I think it’s so whack
They give me shot after shot after shot and shot after that
Want me to lose it, asked to be in front of people and rap
Okay it’s all fun and games until I buckle and snap
I know you know who I am, you’re a fan of these raps
But I’m not in the mood for you to ask for it autographed
Look at your hand and I laugh when you reach out for a dap
Because I’d rather be rude than cool, matter of fact
Man I’m just lookin’ to fight, that’s why some people get slapped
I don’t mean to be mean, just seein’ my inner demons
So be aware when I sluggish be muggin’, drunked up and leanin’
Because you thinkin’

Passed out in all of my clothes, my shoes are still on my feet
I go to bed around 2 and wake up a quarter passed 3
Go to the bathroom and throw back up everything that I eat
My body’s so overworked I look in mirrors and weep
Feel like I’m 50 years old, look like I’m restin’ in peace
I’m a ghost, I’m a zombie, my brain is grilled as salami
Chest is achein’, I’m shakin’, I kinda feel like my mommy
Couldn’t tell me to quit, ‘cuz I don’t listen to shit
‘Cuz afternoon around 6, I twist the cap on the 5th
And that’s just to keep from bendin’ like I’m ‘bout to be sick
From all this stress and anxiety of celebrity shit
I’m suicidal as fuck, I’m dyin’ slow in my cup
I hear this shit way too much; “Michael you’ve had enough”
My baby’s tryin’ to save me but I just scream and I cuss
I’m usin’ her like a crutch, baby sobriety sucks

Tell me ouija board, who's peaking in my window again?
Couldn't be Peter Pan cause he's got a fuckin' evil grin
The ouija board's spelled out E-V-I-L twin, C-A-T-F-I-S-H
Billy that's you again
Fucking right I'm coming out to play, Michael you should bow and pray
Look up to the sun and blind yourself cause I’m The Bible Belt, only want to relate
To the Michael that you want to fight
But it ain't really gonna pay off because that fucking outlaw inside you's gonna get ya either way
Now be the porta-potty for the order
Obviously your the sort of kind of warrior the border probably don't want to let through the door
Cause all the commonal' is that you're poorer to the poor and overworked
Bodies singing out the story they can all be proud of
But the sound of power showers over louder speakers in the boring hip-hop court lobby. (Uh)
I'm a super freak, Rick James bitch, you can do for me
I take a 9 smoke ya man and drop him off with a lighter down on hookah street
I'm everything you could be, make you MC read his elegy while I pull my zipper down behind a tree
Man somebody died here, "Yela', you can pee?" Yep!
I don't care bout a grave on a hater
Hater I don't care if I don't pay when I enter places, if it's a million people waiting to enter
Fuck a VIP I want to see a stage and listen to no roast
Just a wave of a bunch of renegades in a blaze, just place me in the center
I'm sicker than a hick up in the heat with syphilis and hepatitis sucking on a pipe like head of lice and plus survivors that can't be identified
It's probably better that you grab a sweater
Better yet a leather jacket from a closet rack
And maybe get a pack of antibiotics for the psychotic hi-fi phonics that I share
Cause there's a catfish breathing air
There's not two, there's not a there
That's not a day, that's another year
That's another ball park all together Frank
Got a fake gold No Limit's tank
And a loaded 45 pointed at the pitcher
Motherfuckers wanna play a pickup game?
Bones hit the strands
I'm so on my own shit that I won't quit
I'm so on my own out here that I can't quit
If you quarrel leaving, paint it, and grenade the gains in the ground of the shameless Hollywood
Fuck bodies bang this in your church
You can sang with me it's free
Styles I got piles, flows I got miles
Show I got crowds, hoes I'm not proud
Open your mouth, slow leaking out, love you a beer
Towels on the floor, vowels on the floor
Grounds on the floor, now you record? Loud as a boar
Wow what a boy, look in the mirror
I say today is the day that I wake up and walk outside
And the entire globe turns bright purple just by popping this little pill here, ya dig?
I'm the reincarnate of a Vietnam vet. chasing a gook through the jungle
With a mind like a tumble-weed, blood shot eyes, and I'm chewing on a twig
My late great grand daddy fed me pepper and told me it was chocolate
He must of known I need some spice in life, I was too big for this piece of shit town
You try putting a dream inside a box, that box would implode
Dilapidate, evaporate, desaturated with sound
For the folks in the back of the broken Volkswagen, parking the bug in the parking lot and rolling baggies
Walking around the festival, then profiting off the these people yearning, burning
For that LSD, for the lettuce head in me
I give you most props if you grow crops
Keep your tie-die and flip flops
Yippee-ki-yay if you don't stop. (Don'tstop)

Chopped up like an old Suzuki
Strip that bitch like a nudie movie

But I didn't hang up on you, I just hung you out to dry
Clothes line! Little babies, go to school, don't pout and cry
So sick that I make sick sick
Stick dick in a bitch with slit wrist
Just to get a quick fix, sip syrup - sip fix
Hurry get a twit pic, I'm on! (Yeah, I'm on)
And you gon' smell my cologne (I'm on)
Some Issey Miyake or some Bond No. 9 (Yeah, I'm on)

Next thing you know I had her face against a feather pillow
In a cheap hotel yelling at her while I drill her
Like a jack hammer, almost flacked in her
Tap-tap-tappin' that ass like a tap dancer
Then I skeeted, told that bitch to leave or I'ma backhand her
I'm just playing baby, I don't really act in that manner
'Cause my game so suave, I ain't scared of cakin' on a lady
Especially when she give a great blowjob

Come On Over
15 ContributorsCome On Over Lyrics[Verse 1]
Six pack, my life's in a bottle
18 wheels, is my rolling motto
I stayed in the woods, and I played wit a six shot
Still fucked up from all the pills that I swallowed
School was a bore, I had no fun suspended
My whole work was taking weed from a kitchen
Pounds of hick stem, a fifth grade scum bag
Threw bags in for Christmas, I'm high on attention
Skateboard shoes, I had holes in my vision
Before it was cool, I had unwanted attention
Young girls heartbroke, I'm nothin' but trouble
But life is a ditch, bitch, I'm just good wit a shovel
Can you dig it?

[Hook]

Come on over
Be so caught up
It's all about compromise
I see problems down the line
I know that I'm right
I know that I'm right

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you're probably right
I'm probably DUI when I'm driving tonight
I put my feet on the edge and kick my soul to the captain
And just like Travis, I'm surviving the flight
Yelling, "Go Alabama!", holding my banjo
And turn up to Marshall and tune up to Dobro
My truck ain't stuck, I got a winch in the toedo
Had friends but they threw me out, when I'm down and low
Yo what's up to the D-Boyz and the meth lab pimps
All you Kid Rock fans and all you hippies in hemp
If you've got waylon and Johnny right next to Straight Outta Compton
You brought a shovel like mine, you probably been to the ditch
And I can dig it

Superman (Remix)
7 ContributorsSuperman (Remix) Lyrics[Intro]

Yo, Ay man, you know I ain’t perfect… Nobody is. No I stand to be corrected
I know one thing for certain though, these super men, these supermen don’t exist bro
God exists

[Verse 1]

This ain’t no ordinary story, with the hardships and glory
Let me take you deeper into the mind of a child of a bitch with addictions and a wish-list
Dear Father, can I get a man and a big ol’ house?
Lots of money and did I mention lots of money?
Funny how the world turns on me
Me and Mama was all alone
Wanted for the life that we once called home
Trying to get a grip on life gone wrong
Young Yelawolf, to tell the truth I came out just fine
Guess that’s why half of the people around me growing up said I lost my mind
But I just lost the time with friends instead the victim of crime
Touched by the demon’s lust and lost my innocence before 5
Molested, forgive my confessions, I’m an open book
Growing up to hate pentagrams on my seat in class no open book
I dreamed of a gangsta life
Any excuse to let go of this hurt
My folks were atheists, so I couldn’t let go in the church
Anybody who wanted it from me I would back down I was scared
I didn’t know how to win
Back then all I could do was dream about being Superman

Superman I wish I was you
I wish I could kill anything that moves
Superman I wish I could, do anything that you could do
‘Cause you ain’t go no flaws and you don’t shed no tears
You ain’t never scared and you ain’t got no fears
Let the world drowned in my heart’s blood
Let ‘em see me in pain
Let ‘em see me at my worst let ‘em see me be happy again
Let ‘em see my cry let ‘em see me click
And run into the white house with a terminator gun and unload the clip on my government
I never be above my people
I just want more bread
Only to split it, divide it, give it provide it to who deserves it who is searching
For something that makes sense
If you’re happy with this shit, then pump it in the clubs
Then be content but Superman don’t ride on dubs he flies, shit

Oh, Oh you’re looking at the sky watching Superman fly

[Verse 3]

Put on my cape I’m going for it
Fuck it, head on to a freight train
If they can do it in a video then a white boy from Alabama can do the same
(Geronimo!)
You got me fucked up I’m a trend setter
Rock Wal-mart shoes at the Grammys then drop on the roof on a skateboard dude
Whatever, whenever however the hell I want to say it I’ll say it
If I gotta say what I don’t mean sometimes the better
You could just replay it
Just so I could explain it
Just so I could be more human
Just so the devil could see me conquer it and get through it
This is all I got folk a little change and a dream
Not much in the eyes of the now but a billionaire in the scheme of things
A mascot for the ones broken down, now flying high
It’s a bird, it’s a plane, nah it’s Yelawolf riding by in a box (ha)

Oh, Oh you’re looking at the sky watching Superman fly
Around the whole world while it’s falling apart
Oh, Oh we’re looking at the sky watching Superman fly
Around the whole world, while it’s falling apart

Don’t look up for Superman ‘cause he don’t exist
Just trust God
All the kids in the war zones I am praying for you
Wolf is praying for you

(heartbeat in the background) Scared breathing, Scream
The slash of a blade against flesh
Heavy breathing

[Yelawolf]
Happy Friday the 13th, Motherfuckers
[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Go to sleep little boy, don't cry
Black shadows on the wall
Don't look under your bed
Hear footsteps in the hall
Somebody gonna come get me
And take me to the woods, in the fall
Don't look under your bed
Crucifix on the wall
Could it be in my mind
My time has come by
Slayed in the field
Left here to die
What if mamma finds me like this
Under this dirt still alive
I don't know how to resist
All of these thoughts that are running through my little mind
Trouble on show
Scared for my life
Still I want WAR!

Took a knife to the back when I turned around to help somebody close
But I bled just enough to live, half man half ghost
And the dream is dark, fuck it into the dark I go
You want me to be a monster and kill them
You want me to be the one with the blade
You want me to stand up and SCREAM!
You beg for me to go into a rage
Well hand me the machete then, right now
I'll walk into the house and lay you down
Bring you the head of every victim
Man..
Woman..
Child..
I will not decieve you
God said I'll never leave you
And since I can't see you
Then I have to believe you
Yeah I've got a dream
And I've seen
Many, many nightmares unfold
But fear has no hold
On this dream that I control
I control
I control

Thing is missin' from my Southern roots
Manage to take a Cheverolet run up through
The muthaf-cking mud, forget it

Who could tell a story like my uncle when he’s drinking
Product of a working environment, fuck is y’all thinking
Meaning I’m working working harder
Than any artist could ever do it
Simply cause I’m made that way
I build a house around ya ass before you
Can realise that you in a neighborhood that Yelawolf made

Doctors said I lost one third of my blood inside of my body
Ya know I signed papers for my death, I was in I.C.U for a couple days
I was fucked up, but um, you know I made it through, God is good
So to all my fans and friends and family who wished me well, God bless you
Just thought I'd come right back at it, hop in the studio with super hot beats
Hit 'em up I say, man drop a beat, let's hop in the booth
Let's do somethin' real quick you know, just for the fuck of it, cause I need it

Still walk with a limp, like I'm telling my dick to get up
Shaking the babies and making the babies spit up
You babies are maybe gonna get it ah.. shut up!
Might aswel leave myself alone I can't fight it
Im pissed in a bar like I wanna punch a microphone
What did I get on, three pills and I'm at it
Five pills down I'm high as a mothafucka an addict
And an addict I'm adding habits to an already tragic
Situation, now I'm pacing back and forth in a panic
But I see everything in my future as panoramic
See I got a pen and my pen has got me at advantage
Probably let me in the heavens up in the hammock
Love me some fefe dobson my baby's up in a hammock
Rock n' roll hop in your '85 and lock and load
I am a cracker i am no pop artist with pots of gold

Billy's in the backseak drunk hangin' out of that
Window of a rusty dump
Cigarette butts in the floorboard, honey and
Another 30 pack in the trunk

[Verse 1]
And I'm covered in tattoos
Step in this pocket, my number two pencils and shoes
Fruit of the fuckin' loom, boa constrictor boots
Mow up your fuckin' lawn with an '82 vehicle
Put premium gas in a medium glass
Chug it, spit fire, then laugh at a helium mask
Y'all could't fuck with the verse if you rehearsed the diss
6 months later and gave it to DJ Drama for horn stabs
I don't battle, I war
I'm from the country where dope dealers run the rap game
Shit, fuck I'mma battle for?
I ain't with that bullshit, I ain't no matador
I'm MCA tapes, 808s, rattlin' floors
I'm an AK, love, hate, I'm a catalyst for
Crackers who act a rabbit and jump when I crack in the door
Speaking of act a rabbit, y'all ready know who I'm wit
I don't know why you're still acting unsure, shit
I feel like slappin' these whores
Shut up loser, you're stupid
Reach in that cooler and grab me a Coors
It don't matter if you mad that I'm more
Badder and more savage than these other rappers before
Because of my style of clothes, my path and a past record
Bitch suck a sack of shit while I stack up a sack of awards
Internet goons they beg and they cry and they bitch and they moan
But this is what I see when they ride...

And I'm on a higher floor you're gonna need to provide

An ancient mayan convoyage through portals and not arrive
To this door in my mortal mind
Tom Sawyer in the divine
Took four years under the vines
Developed a greater grape and then poured you a glass of wine
Now drink the unthinkable
Put a flame to the tip of that joint and smoke the undreamable
Cause me being who I am is nothing less than a shrink and
Two angels, two demons, a preacher whose leanin'
A prophet, a mystic and they all twisted, jerkin off
A cup and to mention the semen
Nine months later, me and my momma playin' peek-a-boo
You play with me, I'll put a sheet to use
And I ain't talkin klan, I'm talkin meat and boot
Drop a hot verse and a hot deuce
And kick that shit up the street, literally
Bitch, you can eat the shoe
My soul is sad like my old dad
I'm muddy waters infused with Rude Jude's old cold ass
So, drugs make me happy, I'm an alcoholic
Who fell in the shallow end of a swimming pool holdin' a fatty
No Kevin Bone, but that blunt was bone dry
Cuz I held that bitch in the sky
I ain't sacrificing no high
In the hospital with a couple of fuckin' stars
And the first thing I said in that fuckin' car was
[Sample: Jim Morrison]
Well show me, the way to the next whisky bar
Oh don't ask why
Oh don't ask why
Show me, the way, to the next whisky bar

Can't reject the broom, I'm a born street sweeper
Dropping on beats like a born meat cleaver
Leave it to beaver
I'll leave you with a pot of gold
Drained up the creek like a hip hop swimming hole
Dive in headfirst
Weak ones go leg first
I got that dirty bong water I can make a dredger
Look at the lead work
A tundra from the number two
Above you like the color blue
Look up to your cloud now
Another story for your website to talk about
Retweet retweet internet it blog about it
Yeah that's me homie
Mullet to the back, yeah
What I'm 'bout to do with all this culture
It's like lemonade
Squeeze it, drink it, sell it, hustle hard
Running over rappers like a big block, muscle car
Beez in a honey jar
Let me get a hold of that
I run into an hour journey class and take off your cap
Racing through my city, no sweat, take off my cap
Home is where I lay it down, gotta leave my hat
Anywhere I move I'm looking to be meeted back
Seeds in the stash, keys in the 'Lac
Tornado flow, a breeze in fact
Holler atcha' homie, ever seen a slum crowning?
Move horsie I ain't fucking with no dumb pony
Hoes jump on it, do slang to it
Through color poppin', working class music
Work-working class music

Thank for having me

Brick in the Wall
9 ContributorsBrick in the Wall Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well hello folk, how are you today? (Hey!)
I'm terrific actually; doing ok
Usually irritated by what people say
I'm doing better cause my radio don't play
(Your radio don't play?)
Nope, guess it fell apart with
Heartless music or useless artists
Don't be a tool or a target
Hey be a fruit for the harvest
That's right: oranges, grapes not lemons
Be smart, articulate your rhythm
Instead of creating, they giving
Sounds that go to imitate theses children
Trends become laughable at times
Follow and become laughable in your lines (Idea!)
Y'all are so wrong
Straighten up mister

[Hook]
(Leave them kids alone)
And the beat goes on
Talent switched off but the ego's on
(All and all its just another brick in the wall)
Well people dying to ball
But they ain't trying at all
They just lying to y'all
And the truth is
(All and all you're just another brick in the wall)

How many Chucks can a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood
Well if you give Chuck a buck he'll buy wood pre-cut
Hard work, Chuck ain't used to it
Chuck's daddy got a caddy
Cause he used to work the alley
Chucking wood daily for the fiends
Bought a home with a yard
Chuck seems thawed
Now he's living out daddy's dream
So many lames like Chuck fucking hip-hop up
Hip-hop's not dead, its just frozen and crushed
With diamonds and such
With labanous sluts
Babbling bought what?
I don't even know what
I don't even hold much rap shit; I'm gone
More likely I move with rappers who ain't on
I'm clapping for the songs they diss before long
They dig this shit, man, I just

It's that time! Wake up!
Holler at G!
Oh, he got 'em!

[Verse 3]
I'm Catfish Billy and I feel so clean
Cause my music's fresh and so is my team
I flow with this heat but I ain't blowing no steam
I'm keeping this train moving
How I'm proving to be valuable to two or three
And I'm proven to me
Honestly I'm a breeze
Cause what I say on my piece
Is a piece of my world
This is culture I'm giving to you
Listen!
And these bitches on this new wave shit
But they wave white flags when the melee hits
When they say hits, ain't no classics
Ain't no last dibs cause they done did that, pimp
Detonate that roll
Ain't no milk in the bowl
Feeling like you wanna laugh, ha, give it a go!
You're inviting little homies and you're 40-years-old?
Go jump off a building, Superman that, ho

Howdy
14 ContributorsHowdy LyricsIf DJ Frank White isn't on your mixtape, kill yo'self...

[Intro: Yelawolf]
Yeah!
On behalf of Alabama, I just wanna say
The Heart of Dixie is in this bitch
M16, DJ Frank White, my name is Yelawolf
Hello world, hello world, hello world!

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
This morning I woke up feelin like, that I never had a fuckin’ dime
Like I didn’t wake up in the back of the bus that’s finally mine
Why, do I feel like I never had Marshall Mathers’ co-sign sometimes?
Like Radioactive failed, well maybe this time
I’m even not eased to believe that I could be one of the top 5
Maybe when I tell myself I’m one of the best, I’m just lyin’
When my Uncle Buddy calls and ask, I say
"I’m just fine, but I feel like I haven’t made it, Uncle, but I’m just tryin."
Or maybe, I’m just not used to having shit I never had
Never stood in the Winner's Ave
Never said, “I got dinner, dad.”
Shit, never even had the cash to pay my dad for gettin' her back
And Jim I love you, thank you, always remember that
And it feels like yesterday, literally like yesterday
When I couldn’t get one motherfucking fan to come and see me play
When I drove that minivan for the ends, without a license plate
To ATL, so I could play Will Power my demo-tape
Yeah, that’s writing on the wall that I can't erase
He’s a friend of mine that are in the line, and that I can’t replace
If I’m in the line, he’s in the line and we both get a play (church)
This ain’t no crew, it’s a family, so get it straight (church)
So Father you can tell God to part the clouds
And let your sun shine thru the minds of my target crowd
‘Cuz I know some of these people think I’m a certified artist now
But the butterfly’s still a bug, and I’m above where I started, now
Passionate like a political poet in an artist lounge
Hungry like a poor daddy with a gun and a starving child
If you thought it was a flake, then you just a departed clown
And if you thought I was coming hard, well you better think harder now!

And it’s been a long motherfucking time
Since I felt this homesick as I do now
Yeah it’s been a long fucking time
And I just wanna say
Hey! How ya been? Roll Tide! Amen!
The Heart of Dixie’s in this bitch, yeah I’m Dixie rich
But if I don’t have y’all, I ain’t got shit
Gadsden, B-Ham, to the Gump
And all the small towns
Throw it up, it’s that Alabama sound
Much love and I never let you down

‘Cause I might as well be dropped
Back in Gadsden and cuttin’ grass
Or handcuffed on the side of the road, on my fuckin’ ass
Before I become complacent on any level that I’m at
Momma will quit drinking and Obama will smoke some crack
Lost, yeah I may have, my mind
But it takes a lunatic to pursue this shit
Ay that’s fine, because I paid the cost
Really more like a fine, but instead of paying for tickets now
They pay for tickets in line, to see me drain exhaust
The pain from the mic, from the strain it cost
Two-step in my shoes with a shameless walk
300 soldiers I brought, Wolf-Pack follow my lane and put chalk
Around suckers dying for change and talk
The New South’s got a new house
With a frame and a stump
Roots and limbs, the truth’s in him
Yeah I’m a grain of salt
Preachers yelling out, prophets around Wayne
I refrain, I’m a couch, I’m a chair, I’m a seat
A relief pitcher, or beer in the mouth
I’m a sofa to hold ya, just ride the beat homey, it’s over
Whatever rapper would ever say he’s a sober?
I must be smoking bath salt, ‘cuz I’m out of my mind!
I should have built roads for a livin', cuz I never run out of lines

It looks like
Baldhead Skallywag
Maybe that
Baldhead Skallywag, talking this and that
You may have an allergic reaction, shut up bitch
You may have an allergic reaction, hello
Or just plain crazy, hello
Plain crazy, yeah
5150, look, huh?

[Verse]
Ain't nothing wrong with me
Except for maybe my ambition
If I'm crazy for dreaming that I fell down from a long tree
Hit every limb on the way down and bumped my noggin'
A hollow head, my mama said, is someone knocking?
That's why keepin' me from winnin' is a major job
Because I wish a motherfucker would, I pray to God
Yelawolf, and I'm an egg in the frying pan
Couple loose screws on the hub cap tires and
Possibly my papa see, he got the T, the H, the C
He got that private property, he dropped the C
The crop PV to got to me, to pipe the weed
Where did it lead?
It led me down, it led me up, to LSD illogically, yeah
White boys all over the world getting buck cause they know just what I'm talkin' bout
Black boys all over the world getting buck cause they know just what I'm talkin' bout
Brown boy, yellow boy, whatever the hell boy
Follow my trail, they lost the route
So many mofo's running with the mojo
That I could've made a show like Austin Pow--
--wers with words, I'm cold, blizzard McFlurry
No wand, no cloak, Wizard, yes sir, certainly
My box goes 'round the curb real slow, no hurry
Then out my window goes the gun for purging
Look, look like deers in a cage so
Jesus take the wheel, you steer, I'll slay, then
We'll go get a couple cold beers, what you say?
And he handed me a solid gold draco engraved and
Pop, pop, pop, pop, I just drop 4 cops that mob with the Ku Klux Klan
He said, "that's why I say hey man nice shot, that's a nice shot man!"
Blood drops on an undercover white van
Laid down by the hand of a white man
Damn, and I sleep like a baby
With the gold draco layin' on the nightstand
Watching too much Killer Mike (Love)
Sometimes it sucks to be human (Hate it)
Sometimes it sucks to be white (Love)
Dealing with these institutions (Hate it)
Thank God I had mixed children (Love)
That is my contribution (Hate it)
Without them, I probably would snap (Love)
But I'll just choose the music
Suited, booted, I'm ready Eddy
I'll use my noodle like mom's spaghetti
The truth is brutal, it's hard and heavy
But the truth is useful,  them lies are deadly
So keepin' it real is not slang
It's a must-have, gotta live thang
To some of y'all, it's just a new game
Like a muskrat with a shoestring
Toys, now that's what graffiti writers used to call lames
I used to be a graffiti writer, so I know how to scale and bomb trains
Noise, now that's what my Uncle used to call Hip-Hop
90% of the time when I listen to new shit, I say the same thing
Choice, either you gotta make one or they'll make one up for you
Be an original, not a percentage of a dying trend just to make bank
Poise, position of power is a blessing but can be a curse
Be the worth of your soul, not the worth of your pocket and purse now let's get this bitch crank
I just shook y'all motherfuckers
Black truck, masked up, 10 deep, no sleep
Robbing the house on the hillllllllll
I came up with crooks and took that risk to top
Boy I'm that real

Welcome to the Wolf cave!
YelaWolf!
Me my man, Ben Hameen
GA, Alabama Connect
Oh, you wanna know about the south?
Ok, play them the Dirty South
Welcome home then

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the cold hard truth: Bama
Dead Native Americans spirits swarm through the foothills
And whisper through the weeping willows
It moves like a water rapid dancing through your meadows
Diming lights from thick fog and gravel paths
Footprints of a ghost in the wet grass
That lead into invisible prison cells past
The weird rust is symbolic of the blood bath
Just take a look
The younger generations are committing the worst crimes
They lost in a tangle of evident guidelines
Controlled by the unseen and claim one king
And worship a image despite lies and covered schemes
The halt puts a chill in the midnight breeze
Scavengers on the hunt get whatever is free
The breath of the devil throwing metal debris at lost sons

Caught in the wilderness of the south you better
Run for the ditch, there's locusts in the sky
Hide in the cellar, propellers are humming by

Freight trains shaking the walls and taking lives
Stain glass breaking, the steeple's on fire
In the Bible Belt
In the Bible Belt

[Verse 2]
Welcome to my land, my home: Bama
Where the clouds turn green,
Where The Clan marches up and down the small town streets
Where cops look for excitement
Where the oak tree split and burn form the blue lightning
Where the plantation still stands as an undying reminder
Where the Rebel flag waves as an undying reminder
Some try to find there way out
It ain't easy
The economy's bad and most searching for a freebie
In fact, hustlers of every color stay lookin' for the cracks, and loopholes
They stoop low and do jacks
With new clothes and shoes
Hoes, they turn tricks
And follow each-other cause momma just don't give a shit
See black lights and incense they feel roused
Cause no church can soul search like mushrooms,
So young minds, they do lines to feel numb
[Chorus]
Caught in the wilderness of the south you better
Run for the ditch, there's locusts in the sky
Hide in the cellar, propellers are humming by
In the Bible Belt
In the Bible Belt
Freight trains shaking the walls and taking lives
Stain glass breaking, the steeple's on fire
In the Bible Belt

[Verse 3]
Like a thick black cloud of smoke is drifting over the evergreens
The air we breathe ain't safe no more mama
Naw
They polluted the whole city mamma
The whole city is
Filled with thoughts, education, and short dreams
The youth dying to live be all it seems
To be all that we have mama
But I ain't throwin' up my hands mama
No I an't throwin' up my hands
To many grand schemes I must speak
To get free in my mind
If I can free my body
Then I write my song alone in the seas
And put a message in the bottle
For the broken seas to reach everybody
I know it's impossible
But I hope these words convey to hit one soul
To eternally echo through my home and known
With the roots of a child with a son that ain't done
[Chorus]
Caught in the wilderness of the south you better
Run for the ditch, there's locusts in the sky
Hide in the cellar, propellers are humming by

When I was in a coma
You know the reality of it is I could hear the voice of my kids, thinkin' of Daytona
I swear to baby Jesus, I'mma race again, I'm gonna
Grip the wheel tight, click my heels twice
Shake and bake and live the real life
Talladega in the pale moonlight
Strippers in their panties and they moon pale white
Off into the sunset in a motorhome
When I turn that big motor on
No put-put, gas no brake
Oxygen mask strapped on my face
Sponsorship paid me to go fast
So I write a verse quick enough to get cash
Stunt car racing, indie's trash
Tell me french boy, you can kiss my ass

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'mma rule the world
Even have sex with two girls
That's big for a boy like myself
I even get free Waffle House patty melts
Yeah I did good with daddy's help in choosin'
Cause if you ain't winnin' you're losin'
And now I'm grinnin' and cruisin'
Gettin' drunk off of these women and Boones and
I believe I got a gift for this
Cause I can work a standard shifter kit
I won a mini bet on hit or miss
Took a mini car to the graveyard pits
Stay hard on 'em, boy that's it
Hach, spit, grab my dick

Walking in the streets, I hit my knees and I tell the lord that

Sometimes I lay lines about ho's, because I know ho's
I've been froze with cold minds and big behinds
But I refrained, that's old Wayne, I been chose
Not to pose or act, or throw my jersey back
And rap with baggy hats, like you fags with do-rags
Who-the-fuck is you fooling?
Am I a hypocrite because I want some jewels and two twin-pipes under my Chevy box?
An Element on spokes with the heavy knock
I drop this beat
It took a while to realize who I could be
Chief Yelawolf keep it moving to the truth
Tell the youth, we got the purifying sound
The whole globe sewed up, Southside throw it up
This ain't no trend my friend, fuck your pimp-cup
Spill it out with this eight-o-eight kick
While I chill with my chalice
Hypnotic on your suede and you need another outfit
I got that Wal-Mart brand
I stand soul-breathing
Speak full of heaters

But we ain't responsible for guns, we just bleeding

The right time, the right rhymes, that I find
Embedded in my head again
I give back to the earth
And when I'm gone, this track and every verse will live on
Eternally been turning page after page
Searching for words to convey the message
And keep blessing it every day
Won’t let it just slip away
I know the mind is a miracle and I feel I got plenty of shit to say
But I don’t live up on no pedestal
My head is still down to earth
You ain't gotta believe anything I'm telling you
Let it be known, I'm prone to light up a song
Write up a poem, right or wrong, provide you a tone
To last your life long, at last the mic's on
And a cool calm presence surrounds my life form
And I've sworn in my life, never to sacrifice, what I believe in
I was taught to tackle life, head first and network
Collect my efforts
Get ready to sweat, work, harder than ever
See, the art you envisioning
Starts with decisions and
Embark on a mission and
Never lose hope, and if you get hurt
Just put your soul on your sweatshirt
Put your best foot first, remember that the worst is behind you
In time, you find you a rhythm and in, life when you hear it, You can tell its true soul
[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
This day this time, I ain't fucking up, I ain't leaving my kid behind
I ain't tough enough for the devil
Without the shine from the
Son of the one who provide
Who died, who cried as a man, understand
Just to stand in the eyes of the God who created my hand
So that he can understand how we feel
When the seal of the truth got broke
All the hope was lost but he tossed me a key
A Cherokee, merrily doing my deeds, every day
Like needles of an Evergreen, I'm stationary
I'll be dead when the drive in my body drops
But I will fly on, from dirt in the pinecones the seed in the mud
The history of my soul shown
With the all mighty redwood oak
Give it ed’ on my folks on a boat that can float in

But I'm not much into stating the obvious
My ego is just not as big as a Kanye West
Wouldn't know what to do with a fucking Louis Vuitton vest
Guess I would throw that bitch in the ditch with the rest
Of my name brand clothes, except for the Famous
Slumerican dominate, who else got me a check?
You look like you never seen a mullet this fresh hmm?
Still got the Dickies with a cuff and the crease
Bus on a beach, make you wanna go call for police
Yes, the trailer park made a mark on me
I play the cards homie, full deck spread hater
Stars only shine at night so I'm kinda like a spark only grown
Day and night I only need the flick of a Bic
Like a Marlboro to the tip, I'm a cherry glowing
Inhale the fumes exhale very slowly
Ay yo go bring the car for me, get em crunk
Line em up like a bunch of white bitches
Over white residue mixed with baking soda 80's chickens
Sniffing off of maybelline pocket book mirrors
Your mamas 9 o'clock her roll is mine, golden era
Ouija board, ghost in the woods, oh the terror
Spine chilling cold south soul shit
Make bible belt babies like me put my church chair up
Pyramids in the mist with the golden scarab
Mutherfucker what you scared of?
Angelic I am the feather of a rare dove
I don't shape shift, I shift shapes of syllables on my paper
A message to be aware of, so hit your knees choir boy and stare up
When that night hits it ain't the diamonds swinging off a chain
Its the reflection of a kings glare off the pain
Ain't a white boy had this much soul
Since the spirit of Swayze entered Whoopi Goldberg in Ghost
And that was just a movie that was wrote
So uh...if you do be in that boat
I would hope that you would look into my story, not just in my flow
Cuz I'm the fucking bum who asked for change when you said no
With a pocket full of quarters and you had nowhere to go
Facing that shit is hard as fuck to do huh?
No, that ain't Michael Wayne Atha ooh nah
Fans world wide in the stands hoorah
Hit you with the truth, hit you with a 2x4
Or hit you with two bye's, bye-bye, fuck you, kamasutra

[Verse 1: Big Henry]

Man I come from a small town
Dump with a big dream
Where most of us fall short
Cause shit ain't what it seems
The gutter don't hold much
But goons and young sluts
Guns and hard white
One hell of a hard life
Remember them dark nights
I Thought I wouldn't away
I come from a vision
Of pyrex and a piece of ice
I popped in the Killer Mike
Rolled up and got it tight
Drinking like fuck my life
Fuck it I'm on it, right
Imagine them dim lights
Beakers and brass pipes
Them didn't like dude, so harmful for the night
That's how shit move
When there ain't shit to lose
You lookin' at living proof
I give him a better blues
I'm high as a bonfire
Kush got me dumb high
I ride for the team nigga
It's Slum alumni
Along with that "Roll Tide"
I see 'em with four eyes
They heard I was coming nigga
I'm coming with more guys
Cause I could remember
No coat in the winter
Mama working two jobs
Peanut butter was dinner
It was me and my brother
Feeling somebody would get us
Had no name brand clothes
Them hoes laugh when I enter
Now I stand and deliver
What you need come and get it
To pushing narcotics around a circle at Forest River
Asking a nigga
Yeah Big Henry get which ya
A dream and a bag
Can't you see that picture
Man I'm out on the block
Got an ounce and a Glock
Where the gangsta's party
Snoop Dogg and 'Pac
Where the sun don't shine
Where the young hoes ball
Where The corner's hot
Snitches talking to cops
Looking up from the bottom
You only dream about the top

With boobs hoppin' up and down profusely in a perfume shop
I put culture and words in a huge knot
And let 'em figure it out like it's a rubik's cube block
I let you enter my house, but the room's locked
So you see me like you see a movie when the perfect view's blocked
I abuse props
Take 'em with a grain of salt
Like you take a grain of Wheat
And Boil it to brew hops
Still drinking, yeah
I swear I tried to stop
But being sober is like being a soldier on goon watch
I can't relax
So me and the crew shop
Sound scientists buying the finest of that boom knock
Let the loot drop
In the boondock, my soul's a tomb popped
Thanks, the world knows my name because of the trunk that you popped
So fuck dollar stores lookin' for brooms, mops
Soap, cereal, they might, but you not
Now, Famous Family look at my shoe drop
Wow, Travis Barker and me carry a tattoo flock
Ya snooze ya lose
Cock suckers confused, Ha!
But see for me it ain't no news to do rock
But to pursue spots at the top next to a few gods
That were born veteran groomed
Obvisouly watched over, I'm do lots
So give me that blue dropped Chevy
And Throw some spokes on it
Pokin' out, Ooh Ah!
Parking in front of that Maybach like dude stop
Now let 'em choke on that 1985 fumes brah
I been on some butterflying el cocoon batter
Take flight and you can hear That sonic boom shock
This Alabama tornado spitting just blew rocks at your rooftop
You're still looking for proof, stop
It's right in front of your glue sniffer
You fools enter, the cave with the caucasian, to be confuse not
With any other bafoon jock
Motherfuckers ante Up
When I inject the vein check the spoon's hot
I'm that boy
Yelawolf's in the mood, I
Howl in the mic like the wolf does when he moon watch
These cowards are doomed, popped, busting, and chewed, Blah!
Fucking disgusting to taste
Give me the soup 'ma
Bucket of fucking disgrace
Such a horrendous display of a king
Who is the matriarch of this new pop?
They threw me under the table as soon as possible
Now I'm just looking Up every bitch's dress in hip hop

Cause the boys in the woods are always hard
Some of them white-trash some of them ride hogs
Knowing nothing in life but trucks and sticks
Don't quote me boy cause I ain't said shit

[Verse 1]
Now, I like my butter and greens, I like my plate full of soul
I'm the one who got that sloppy hooker holding my doe
I'm the king of the strip if strip means I get down
I'll pull trick and make em' put a dick in the fucking ground
I'm as smooth as it gets
I'mma move into this, Double-wide with a porch and pay 200 of rent
When you run into this might as well run into bricks
I been learning how'da stack you, put a track on deck
Put a dollar on the table and stand up on your bitch
Holler if your able and let me see how dirty you get
If your feeling like a fighter put a plug in your clip
Cause if you empty ammo at me you got more to deal with
More relatives then a cat with kitty litter and piles
With motherfuckers born to give a cop quotas and files
Should I show you the style or should I show you door
Well, I could show you how'da hide a pound of weed in the floor cause...

Deer Mama
12 ContributorsDeer Mama Lyrics[Verse 1]
I used to sit inside a '87 Silverado
With a baby bottle sippin Nyquil
Cuz my mama wanted me to sleep through it all
Wake up
Must've been the dreams she was after but I guess the cocaine and the weed called
"Hey, love"
Mama, fix your make up
Mascara lines lookin' like a mistake with a paintbrush
If only Picasso could see the pot holes
He would never put the masterpiece in the paint truck
And Mona Lisa, can I get a date on Friday?
And if you're busy, well I can't rush
My mother's son played base like a fake brace
I know I got the gold, but I can't touch
But I'm still runnin' on the other far side of your mind
Only known to the love that I can't clutch
18 came quick, dealin' with the same shit
And I'm lookin' at my homie like "hey, bro"
She ain't never gonna change
Out of the bought fairy tale
It's a song that she'll never sing
Lady pitiful of silly Wayne
I shoulda never came
And she gave a hillbilly a wedding ring
Now they're stuffin' nickelbags in the cellophane
And a single wire living by a train in the sellin' lane
I been runnin' by the storm so long that I never get wet
I could smell the rain
And I can't change that picture
But I can put it in a better frame
Throw it up on the wall of a three story home
That I own so I can go back on it and celebrate
And like Big Boi, let it never fade
Get away in the space like Andre
And thank god for my mama's mistakes
Cuz now I got something to say

So bust down the blunt, wrap the THC
That's 24 chrome on that Classic Caprice
What you know about me? Not a goddamn thang
Fatboy Mac, I let my nuts hang
I do it how I do 'cause it's just my thang
You can hate if you want but I ain't gon' change
How you gon' explain when I leave pop your brains
Leave it on a curb till their washed off by rain
When I'm in a booth man I'm high octane
So tell Dr. Dre did it ain't no game
'Cause this documentary

Hail to my enemies and fuck what they tellin' me

You holla for real and complain 'cause you got it

There is no bitch in me
Unless ya mean South America on the coast nude

How could ever there be a dude with a handy pack
That swings the pinpoint shot when I'm in attack
Easy if you had practice how to lame an ass-hole
'Cause all my life I would [?] back

Shit I’ve Seen
6 ContributorsShit I’ve Seen Lyrics[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Yeah, uh
Half of these muthafuckin' rappers don't know shit
Ain't seen a gangsta, ain't seen a brick
And they wonder why when OGs come around Yelawolf
I get the respect I get
'Cuz I never walked into another man's house
And tell him what I think about the way he lives
I done a lil dirt of my own, and I won't throw stones
So I get back what I give
Reach for the tool, homeboy, go ahead
If you wanna be dead, homie, be dead
Who am I to tell you not to pop a trunk
If you feelin' like a punk
From the he said, she said?
Life's not a choice, it's a win or lose
So what's it gonna be, him or you?
Did he lie on your bed
Is she lyin' to your head
Well
It all depends on the truth
See, I'm realistic (yeah)
And everyday can't be terrific (yeah)
I done seen one of my boys get ticked off
And put his hands on a loaded AK and lifted it
Up in the air, and then we saw him carry it
Into the club, I know he wanted to bury him (hahaha)
My crew was laughin, I was scared as fuck
And they thought it was hilarious
Damn
(Really, thats how y'all do it? Shit)

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
Yeah
I let you take a second to introduce you to pain
When everybody goin' through it, they goin' the same
They in they struggle but they focused on makin' they change
If anybody get in the way they makin' it rain
If it go to me, then I probably doin' the same thing
If I ever could I'll forever be reppin' the same game
Rappin' off thinkin' "I promise I'll get the same thing"
In the back of the Maybach or sellin' somebody, mayne
Gettin' brain like I was only here to learn something
When I'm done here trying to earn something
Fuckin' with me I guarantee I'mma return something
Raise some drama then show up and try to burn something
I'll do my dirt and then I never pay it back
I'm dealin' with it and they could never take it back
You can’t respect, the city been awake
Got attacked, got it, I can't hear nobody taking that
You wanna hit the block and I'll thug on anybody dreamin' to get away
And to the love I got for the streets, the hood
Call up any nigga who come that and try to fit in, I send 'em away
Yelawolf, go get the whip, I got this
I open the gate, ain't no way they could stop this
They want it with us, you can tell 'em about this
Lookin' for something pretty, you can tell 'em it's not this

Pray on my god, I believe it's too hard
Don't reach to the dogs who believe the facades
Don't reach too far to compete with the dog
Because deep in the heart, they wanna give you this all
I wish I could be the
One to say I warned you
Don't pay any attention
Man, I wanna ignore the haters
But I can't afford to leave them alone
They say that Yelawolf ain't never been in the dark
In trailer parks, they made their mark
I gotta make it hot, cuz I was given a pardon
I gotta play the role
Serial killin' rappers like I had a serial code
In every city with a cereal bowl
When I rap, peer in to my soul
I'm in the light like a deer in the road
Clear in control, my spirit is old
I'm hearin' the gold, I'm hearin' the foes' hoes
And it falls like a rock
But that don't mean that you hard like one
You want the credit for getting gutter forget it
You muthafuckas pulled out the credit card and run
Street credit won’t put bullets in your gun
But it might put a stray bullet in your son
Daughters, uncles, aunts, friends and loose ends
Becomes tangled up when it comes undone

Fuck 'em all I'll hold my balls and urinate on the industry
Fuck 'em, I'm pissin' in a barrel of beez

Mamaaaa! Mama, look; no hands
I dip my dick in a jar of honey, and I'm peein' in a bucket of fire ants
Wait, them ain't fire ants! Shit, them bumble bees!
But I still won't budge, I don't give a motherfuck
If they crawled on my jungle weeds
I'm done with these, overrated, slow-paced, wanna-be motor bikes
You're tricycles, peddling hard
A bumble bee has one strike
Them soldiers slow your roll; you're supposed to be in line
Twenty-fours never made a rapper spit hard
You can only get a buzz when you fly
Amazing, n' craving them flowers like women, bouquets
Set a purple haze, Yelawolf I have an MC pushing up daisies, grinning
Standing six feet, nothin'
And I drank a whole lake
I gotta go real bad
And I got a belly ache
The great flood is back; I'm attacking the best of the best
Surround them with my sound, in this yellow sea of stress
Hurting, long waiting, hard writing, and shitty deals
And if that don't drown ya', you'll hit the Chevrolet windshield; splat!

Headed to the lab with a Ding-Dong
Like a deep sea fishing pole, and
Throw my line in with the bait hook
Got a great white following my books
Shit that I wrote floats like a bobber
Sit back unappeared, unbothered
Jumping up when I see it bump
Just let the shark come near
Here fishy fishy! Here fishy fishy fishy fishy; now swallow
This, piss, bitch; rich in nutrients
Let it go in your party bowl
Sticks to your dips and chips
Licks, taste, great; it'll make you live
Not dog a bite; I'm Golga-white
With a bottle breaker, and then a keg of Heineken
Fight like an Irishman
Fight like a wolf; I'm still growling
Marking my territory with my leg hiked, you know where to find him

Chopped down, like an overgrown bush with a weed eater

Run up on that 808 kit, take a shit
Hike my paw-paw, and drain 'me lizard
Wolf relieved himself on top of the track with a three-liter
Did you like this song before we did it? (Naw) Me neither!
Well pull out your Johnson motherfucker; if you got a twat then squat
Do it if you want to little mama; if you got what's hot, then drop
But don't sit on the meat cleaver; you can't clean up blood with a mop
I do my shit sober... do you need some X when you rock?
Well here's a triple stack (HAUUUUUH!) --now pop
Hot rocks, meteor damage putting holes in your Chevy top
I do not stop
Ceiling is damaged, now you're really riding in a drop
You could ride or die, or die to ride a drumkick, and then get shot
Blew by the police by the hot shit security; you are stopped
Hold up, freeze
Step out of my vehicle, rewind
This shit is pitiful
Must I get rid of you?
Must I piss on you?

Makeup
5 ContributorsMakeup Lyrics[Intro]
Everybody wear make-up sometimes man
But you gotta walk outside
And let that rain, just wash it off man
Look at what's around you man
How people got it bad man, you know what I'm saying?

[Verse 1]
Say no more, I need music to get me by
Simple beats, simple life, and a simple rhyme
Momma taught me to hustle for piece of mind
Never thought I'd get caught in this long line
For the truth, I don't worship a stone or shrine
Put my faith in the pen, now let me fly
Through the wind of the rhythm I hold tight
On the streets of Seattle, in cold nights
Father give me the strength to continue
Oversee all the prayers I send you
My heart's open to people who love back
Put my soul in a song, am I wrong for that?
Never was, some how I still catch flak
If agreeing, why they fight over white or black
Keep the vision of peace but I still shoot
I'm a rebel for reasons you won't prove

[Hook]
Just look at the sunshine
In the morning when you wake up
Go stand in the rain
And let it wash off all your make-up
Pick up a flower
Look at a rainbow
Even the lightning and the thunder
What we here for?

When this gets too heavy to carry sometimes
I break down and just let it fall from my eye
Even though it still hurt when I get back up on my feet
To see that nobody's seen me cry
Waters waters a Havel for pain
Devil he came, and he walked in the skies
But I throw it the opposite name
Reason I came, to open up your eyes
And whatever I say, know that I mean well
Every last word that I spitted
This is all I want to be
So to give you my all
I make sure it's in every sentence
This poet ain't fake no
From the mouth of a fresh spree
Hot beats so, from up under the dirt roads
And the concrete, from my people with no clothes

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So many times I thought of suicide
Giving up is the easiest way to die
Put my life in the barrel and go to sleep
Never witness the birth of my own seed
Never had the will power to graduate
Went to too many schools to keep an A
Carry pipes in my bag, smoking at lunch
Away from reality all at once
I saw momma outside on the porch crying
Saying she can't pay the rent but she really trying
Would I be embarrassed to get food stamps?
Daddy never came home from the school dance
Ashamed of the way that I been feeling
Selfish enough to give up on living
When she made it this far
Working at a bar
With no where to turn but the sunshine

It's my time
I Need it
I Need this all black
Black, black 1979 Chevrolet
Sitting on my driveway
Smoked out

[Verse 1]
Rolling in my brand new Chevy
Candy-black, paint is deli'
Butters all round, interior blazing
Wood grain flow with the navigation
Sun beam on the trunk
Bust through town with [?] gods
Buzz lights on, in and out
[?], rolling south
Out the window, driving fast
Build a temple of this map
Can I speed up till I hit the curb
Breaking this ride would be absurd..
This spacing shit
Pop the hut, palms on deck
Love to roll zigzag
King ship, space wad

Slim walk, ride o' kicking

Splash back harder than loud
Creekwater I'm paddling down
How does it sound? holler back
Earn my will, swallow that
Dirt road, loose rock
Pedal to the car, 50 high socks
See me when I stop, yell when I'm gone
But I can't hear you when I'm zoning
Done turned off my secular phone
Jerk, jerk leave me alone
Buddy I'm high, too elevated
Church on the cloud
Maybe sunday with my super clean machine
Even with mud on my high beams
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Windows sprayed, no tint
Cuz you can't see my face
135 down the highway
Under control early friday
Just got a wax, sparkle, sparkle
Thinder cuts are also artful
Won't get this, hmm why?
I don't think I really wanna sent you by
Relax, this ain't cheap
Minimum wage won't get you these

Couple years ago ain't nobody handled it
But I was broke as shit
Struggling with a sandy Benz
Yea, fuck yea talking 'bout drugs

That make a middle class fan be friend
Slumerican the family grand
You're in a fan, they scram

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Empty can of gas
Well a little bit leff at the bottom
Just enough to hope that it gonna get light
The trailer park is wobblin'
Trash bag full of freon in my system
You think Tyler's a goblin
If that Future's Odd
My past is odder like I worked the lachine
Stick's and trash to build a dam
To leave the gutters clockin'
Inflood the street's with mother's grease
And all this butter poppin'
Yeah I might have had a chance to be mechanic
What's my other option?
But I'm crackin' the bottom of a complex
With papa's southern rock
So go get Janis Joplin
Dig her up from her grave and then indulge it
Drinking Jack is not like Courvoisier, and
Chris Styles was when he first came
To the rap video waves
And PBR's and dime bars
Is a trim for this idiot age (fuck that)

I like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud

[Verse 1]
You know the sun shines real bright in the mornin' time
Through the window of my trailer in the pines
I need a little somethin' to shade that light
A beer buzz starts my day off right
Granny's in the kitchen, cookin' and singin'
Zoup get me up, look at what he brings in
Hey, ain't that a 12 pack, buddy?
"Yessir, you know I ride dirty"
I ain't even got a shower yet
But I devour a 12 oz. in three seconds
And it's an alchie's weddin'
I married the Bud and now I'm in Heaven
Sheryl Crow is the queen
I really I wish I had her here to drink with me
But it's just me and Dixie
And I'm one down, [?] hit me!

My eyes are foggy, I don't feel groggy

Fire up the grill and call some bros

All I know is that I make eskimo's sweat, when I grab a pen
When it's below ten, degrees
Act like I haven't blessed you, pretend, sneeze
Walk on the beat bent knees
Landlord still buggin' "Can I get the rent please?"
I told her I got the money, in my Jiz-eans
Don't worry, I spit sixteens like zipped seams
(Quook, Pow) I fossilize emcee's
T-Rex knock I leave water in cups rippling
Said you on vacation just to ask you (Are you tripping!?)
Only became your teacher just to pass you (Rik Riiiing, Riiiing)
Tell your bitch she should keep her eyes closed
I'm a fire-man, I put the water inside these hose
Put her face in the cannon, like Alamo
Take a picture of her drinkin' whisky, in designer clothes
I told her I would take her out for sushi rolls
But I fed her dog food, straight Alpo
WHAT?! Did I lie to her too much, confide in her too much
Said I was ridin' with the bucks, My pride was hidin' my love
But I believe I'm alive I'm alive ya ain't live enough
To fuck with this poor pimp and these hoes I'm allowed to fuck
Could it be the way that I fuck with a big dick (Haha)
Switch the position let me bring it like Slick Rick (Watch)
Get on all fours baby, you know how we do it shawty
No I don't have a Mercedes but I know how you like Bacardi
Hop up in the bucket seat, let me make room for ya
Wal-Mart white panties, let me move 'em for ya
Alabama I'mma bring the fuckin' truth home
So tell me hater what would you like up on your tombstone
You were lookin' for a fight to pick with me
So tell me what the views like sittin' six feet deepYou might also like1Embed

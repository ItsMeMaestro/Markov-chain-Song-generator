yesterday.
yesterday.
all my troubles seemed so far away.
now it looks as though theyre here to stay.
oh I believe in yesterday.

suddenly.
im not half the man I used to be.
theres a shadow hanging over me.
oh yesterday came suddenly.

why she had to go.
i dont know she wouldnt say.
i said something wrong.
now I long for yesterday.

yesterday.
love was such an easy game to play.
now I need a place to hide away.
oh I believe in yesterday.

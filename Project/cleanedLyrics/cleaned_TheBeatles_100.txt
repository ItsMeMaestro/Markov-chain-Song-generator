for No One.
your day breaks your mind aches.
you find that all her words of kindness linger on.
when she no longer needs you.

she wakes up she makes up.
she takes her time and doesnt feel.
she has to hurry.
she no longer needs you.

and in her eyes you see nothing.
no sign of love behind the tears.
cried for no one.
a love that should have lasted years.

you want her you need her.
and yet you dont believe her when she says.
her love is dead.
you think she needs you.

and in her eyes you see nothing.
no sign of love behind the tears.
cried for no one.
a love that should have lasted years.
you stay home she goes out.
she says that long ago she knew someone.
but now hes gone she doesnt need him.

your day breaks your mind aches.
there will be times when all the things she said.
will fill your head.
you wont forget her.

and in her eyes you see nothing.
no sign of love behind the tears.
cried for no one.
a love that should have lasted.

was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure.
did she understand it when they said.
that a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure.
will she still believe it when hes dead.

within You Without You.
we were talking.
about the space between us all.
and the people.
who hide themselves behind a wall.
of illusion.
never glimpse the truth.
then its far too late.
when they pass away.

we were talking.
about the love we all could share.
when we find it.
to try our best to hold it there.
with our love with our love.
we could save the world.
if they only knew.

try to realise its all within yourself.
no one else can make you change.
and to see youre really only very small.
and life flows on within you.
and without you.

we were talking.
about the love thats gone so cold.
and the people.
who gain the world.
and lose their soul.
they dont know.
they cant see.
are you one of them.

when youve seen beyond yourself.
then you may find peace of mind.
is waiting there.
and the time will come.
when you see were all one.
and life flows on within you.
and without you.
